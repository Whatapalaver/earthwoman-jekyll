Exactly 1 week before the autumnal equinox in the year 2007, I acquired myself a smallish but hideously overgrown allotment plot in West London – Manor Road Allotments in Richmond, to be precise. This blog will describe the highs and lows as I, earthwoman, a youngish, single-handed woman whips it into shape and brings home mountains of delicious produce and tries to store it in the ice cube sized freezer compartment of her pokey fridge.

When I say single-handed I am of course hoping that my parents, who live a mere 5 hrs away, will make frequent visits to help assert human authority over the wannabe wilderness region. If we are lucky, my dad might also pass by to write guest posts, passing on his weird and eclectic horticultural knowledge to the masses – or his daughter at least.

Earthwoman is also occasionally referred to as [warriorwoman](https://warriorwomen.co.uk), a rather grandiose misnomer. Under this pseudonym she completes outlandish running feats and generally gets hot, knackered and sweaty – not for the fainthearted.
