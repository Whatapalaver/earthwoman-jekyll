I didn't think I'd get to the allotment this weekend but while I was in the park, trying to squeeze in a long run for my [half marathon training](https://www.warriorwomen.co.uk), it struck me what a great gardening day it was. Didn't take much for me to cut the run short and head off to the plot.

What a lovely day, plenty of signs of spring, vibrant colours bursting out of the soil.

My legs were aching a bit too much for digging (I'm full of excuses) but I did do something productive - seed sowing has commenced! I know I am way too early but I'm working on a tip off from my Dad who has suggested I might get away with an early batch of spring onions, radish and greyhound cabbage.

My early broad beans and peas have quite a spacious row between them so I'm trying to utilise the cosy spot under the cloche for bringing on the seedlings. Hopefully the existing crops will provide some protection for my seeds and not grow so quickly that they turn in to the neighborhood bullies.

I left with another sack of rocket. It's starting to taste very strong though and I'm not such a fan of bitter salad leaves so I may check out some cooked arugula recipes, I'm bound to be able to do something pasta related.
