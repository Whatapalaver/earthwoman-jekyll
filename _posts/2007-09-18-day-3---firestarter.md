I'm not a particularly skilled arsonist, a heap of dried weed roots, decades old piles of the Evening Standard and the key ingredient - lighter fuel and a zippo. Still no flippin flames. I would be useless with the survivalists flint and tinder method.

I did eventually get a hint of a flame but as you can see, I didn't manage to make much of an impact on the ever growing pile of crud.I took this week off to try an get a head start on this allotment (and to get some [long runs](https://www.warriorwomen.co.uk) in) but unfortunately my immune system decided it was an ideal time to take a break too. I've got a rotten cold and am therefore struggling to make much of an impact of the plot. I've sent out an emergency parental visitation order though, weather permitting my parents will be here at the weekend to lick this place into shape!

I managed a bit of soil tickling today and uncovered this worm who is clearly feeling as sorry for itself as I am. Quite cute for a wriggly thing.One task I can manage from my sick bed is allotment planning combined with seed ordering. I've got a couple of bulbs of garlic, 2 bags of onion sets and a pack of broad beans, winging their way to me now. Just about the only things available for me to plant this late on.

Hopefully I'll find a source of spring cabbage plants before its too late as well. Oh and I also fancy installing a raspberry fence which is another autumnal task. Dunno how it got to be autumn so soon, I've still been holding out for a summer.

Can't hide from the seasons when you're gardening though.

I paced the plot out today and it seems I have a 40ft * 40ft plot - jolly handy having foot sized trainers. I drew up a temporary, back of a fag packet, plan today, based primarily on a stash of flag stones that I've spotted in a corner - hopefully they are free for all but I suppose I better check before I nab them.
