It was a bit of a struggle to find enough for photos for Septembers month in pictures. What a wash out it's been. I've hardly made it to the plot at all this month.

I've started saving a few seeds and amazingly some of them have even dried out enough for storing. In the specimen jars I have poppy, blue mist, foxglove and sweet peas. The first two self seeded everywhere and almost all plot holders would call these weeds but I love them and can't bring myself to yank them up when they blossom in the middle of my semi-pristine rows.

It'll look like Flanders next year.
