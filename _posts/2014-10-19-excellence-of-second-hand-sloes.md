In search of suitable bottles for the preparation of the annual glug of sloe gin I found last years experimental sloe port.

I planned on leaving it for 2 months to mature but here we are 10 months later and I can only say that it has matured fantastically.

It is a crying shame that I have an 8am Monday morning presentation but if they knew how smooth this tipple was, I’m sure they’d forgive me for a lacklustre performance. I can only hope so anyway.
