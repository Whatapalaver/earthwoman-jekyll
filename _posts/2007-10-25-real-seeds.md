There was a lovely treat awaiting me when I got home today, which just about made up for the terrifying night-time cycle commute. Two seed packages had been delivered, one with 3 packets of organic freebies from Thompson & Morgan and the other containing my purchases from the [Real Seed Catalogue](https://www.realseeds.co.uk/).

I love these seeds, it's like receiving tiny hand made packages of sweets. The dwarf french beans look like yoghurt coated delights and the cultivation tips are fantastic - far better than anything I've seen in the "standard" seed catalogues. You should be able to read the instructions on the back of the gherkin packet to get an idea of what I mean.

The Real Seed Catalogue specialise in rare and heirloom specimens and provide all the information you need to collect and store your own seeds - its a wonder they don't put themselves out of business really. I've reproduced these photos specifically for my dad, we've decided to go in for a bit of a seed share this year, so this is a heads up on what he's going to get from me.
