I staggered across to my allotment today, laden with compostable materials. Not sure what the heck happened on the waste front last week but I'm going to blame the veg box. I could barely carry the bag of peelings, vacuum crud and shredded paper and by the time I added my friends sack of grass clippings to the load I was really struggling.

Still, it's got to be done. Compost is my new passion of the moment and as I have three bins to fill I can't slack on the waste production front. I was even tempted to pick up a few discarded pumpkin heads on my way but that was just too much.

It was practically dark by 3pm today so I had to light my way by a rather impressive bonfire. It was my best so far and actually managed to make an impact on my mountain of couch grass roots. It's also provided a good heap of high potash ash that should give my fruit trees a good spurt for next year. I've been building the fire on the site I've earmarked for the Spartan tree due next month.

I'm really enjoying the preparation stage of this allotment and am just a tad worried about what I'm going to do when I've got everything sorted. I have a low attention span and get rapidly bored by tasks so the new plot is ideal for me - every 5 mins I can hop to a new job. Today I did bonfire building (which is actually quite hard to get bored of), lacewing hotel making, weeding (doh!), transplanting, manky chard nurturing, cloche making and compost stirring.

I was fortunate to find my broad beans pretty much in one piece but I wasn't going to risk it with the pigeons and chose to knock up a protective fleece cloche with my last bits of blue piping. The fleece turned out to be the perfect size, something like 8m by 1.5m and it only cost Â£2.99 from Wilkinsons. Wish I'd got another pack at that price.

I mentioned last week that my first delivery of plug plants had got lost in the postal strike. Well my little chard plants and assorted brassicas finally turned up after 3 weeks locked inside a cardboard box. Most of the plants were complete mush as you'd expect and went straight into the compost pile but a few of the chard plants seemed to have a few leaves still in the land of the living. I've nurtured them on my windowsill for a few days and stuck them in the plot next to their more vibrant brothers today. I'm not holding out too much hope but fingers crossed.
