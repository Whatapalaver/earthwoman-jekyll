You probably have just enough time left to follow in our footsteps and create the worlds most delicious hedgerow jam.

Two weeks ago we stumbled upon a laden bullace tree and decided to gather ourselves a few fruits for a stewed pudding. They were so abundant and easy to reach that a few fruits rapidly turned into a carrier bag full and I had inadvertantly created myself the chore of an evening’s worth of jam making.

I am deep in the depths of a sugar free, gluten free, dietary phase so jam making is not high on my to do list.

Fortunately the kids are less faddy than me and were happy with the opportunity to sample.

Bullace jam is apparently the “best jam ever”, and two weeks post production it is still the preserve of choice. Today I was told it forms the perfect accompaniment to applewood cheese and toast, beating quince jelly hands down.

So if you are quick, you might still be able to gather some wild plums for your own supply of champion jam. Here’s the recipe:

Ingredients:

- 2lbs of bullace wild plums
- 1.5 lbs granulated sugar
- 1/2 pint water

Method:

1. wash the fruit
2. put all the ingredients into a large preserving pan and bring slowly to a boil
3. spend ages stirring and fishing out the stones
4. bring up to the boil and either heat to the jam setting point 105'C (test with a jam thermometer) or test for a set on a cool saucer.
5. pour into pre-sterilised jars, seal and wait for the bread to toast.
