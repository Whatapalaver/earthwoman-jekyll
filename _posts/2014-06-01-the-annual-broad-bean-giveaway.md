he beans have been tremendously successful this year which can only mean that the Annual Broad Bean Giveaway will be more challenging than usual.

This event sees us sneaking from neighbour to neighbour trying to catch them unawares so we can thrust a carrier bag of un-podded and usually unwelcome beans into their hands.

Typically the neighbours are one step ahead of us and have closed the curtains, plunged the house into darkness and feigned longterm absence.

One may wonder why I grow so many unpopular beans. I don’t much care for them myself actually, but it’s hard to turn your back on the singularly most successful crop you have and besides I do so enjoy the groans when I put them on the teenagers dinner plates.
