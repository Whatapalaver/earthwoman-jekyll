I went to Shakti's house yesterday to see how the seedlings were, I thought they'd be drying out and need a little freshening up, but how wrong could I be?

She has taken this nurturing responsibility very seriously. I found her sitting in the brightest house in the neighbourhood, trying to watch the telly in her sunglasses because the seed trays were on the floor soaking up the rays in front of her industrial sized anti-SAD daylight bulb.

She is doing a wonderful job. The sweet peas now have multiple leaves and don't even look too straggly, every other seed has germinated as well except for the two pepper varieties which I imagine will pop up in a few days.
