I rounded the corner whistling away to a tune on the iPod and came face to face with this scene of blunt trauma nastiness.

Blasted vandals.

Not worth getting upset about it though and as my trangia and 'room of one's own' mug were still intact, I managed to start the whistling again.

I ignored the DIY implications of the damage and got on with the digging. I had spud planting on my mind and didn't want to put it off while the clouds were threatening to turn soggy.

I'm pretty pleased by the results, I've pulled my hamstrings and twisted my back but there isn't much that surpasses the satisfaction of a freshly turned plot and a neatly stacked heap of hot horse manure.

While still ignoring the shed I thought I'd whizz around and complete many an outstanding task.

My second double row of Broad Beans went in, Bunyards Exhibition next to autumns sowing of Aquadulce. I'm pretty sure that I was close to cropping my beans this time last year but I suppose it has been a harsher winter.

I got a load shallots through the post yesterday, another forgotton and impulsive purchase from last year.

I noticed on the invoice that I have another two bags of onion sets due to arrive in the near future as well. Having only just got over the [planting of the 5000](https://www.earthwoman.co.uk/2008/10/01/honey-beer-and-onions/) I'm not exactly looking forward to this delivery. I need to be a little more sedate with my purchases, at this rate I'll only be cropping onions and spuds.
