Blimey, July is a busy month.

I've been on the plot almost every day and yet don't seem to have done anything constructive. The time is taken up by watering and picking crops (not that I'm complaining), with precious little time for making any last minute sowings.

I haven't had much time for blogging recently so there are a few new photos in the montage.

The greenhouse has worked wonders and I'm now pulling out bucket loads of the most delicious tomatoes, a handful of chillies each week and the promise of some juicy aubergines.

Outside the courgettes have just, in the final days of July, started to put on a little growth spurt and I'm reassured that there will soon be a glut. The cabbages are so tasty but my labeling discipline has been slack and I don't know what variety they are. The runner beans are cropping so well now that the bean construction is threatening to collapse and I'm delighted to announce the appearance of two micro-caullis.
