The weekend was a scorcher, which was a blessing as I had quite a few onion sets to plant. I arrived thinking I had a fairly big job on my hands trying to find a home for about 200 onions but when I opened the padded envelope and ripped open 1 of the 3 sacks of onions, I realised that 1000 might be nearer the mark.

I was pretty determined not to run out of onions quite as quickly as I had this year but 1000 might be overkill. Much sucking of teeth and sharp intakes of breath followed as I wondered where they were all going to go. I could actually turn the entire plot over to onions at that rate but that was going to require a lot of digging. My big job just got a lot bigger, so I did the only thing that can be done under the circumstances. I opened a bottle of honey beer and had a little sit down to think.

Two bottles of waggledance later, the onions were still sitting there, so I gave one pack to my neighbour and reduced the challenge by a third. Success!

A couple of wonky rows went in before I started watering and was pleased to create my very own rainbow. Having the foot of the rainbow land in my Brussel Sprout patch must augur well for a bumper Christmas harvest, it didn't unfortunately mark the site of a pot of gold.
