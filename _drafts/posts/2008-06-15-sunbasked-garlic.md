A lot of my crops have been cleared from the ground this month. I've just about eaten all the onions, both rows of broad beans have been scoffed and the remains have filled all three of my compost bins.

The plot is looking bare but at least the garlic looks promising.

The strawberries have gone nuts producing runners faster than fruits so I've lopped most of them off. This particular variety are so tasty that I've kept a few back to propagate some more plants.

The peas won't last an awful lot longer, Feltham First was a good variety for an early crop but they aren't particularly tasty. They are very starchy and taste like marrowfat peas when they get a bit bigger. I might use them again for an overwintering crop but I'll have to hunt around for a sweeter spring sown variety.
