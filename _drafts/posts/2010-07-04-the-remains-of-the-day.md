You know it's been a great evening when you finish off with a couple of empty bottles of fine ale and a bucket full of fresh produce. Days really don't get much better than this.

We sat in the sun and ate Ratte potatoes boiled with freshly podded peas and pondered over the mystery of carrots. Yet again I managed to produce just 3 carrots out of 3 assorted packets of seed.

I don't understand how you can grow 3 fine specimens and then about 300 abject failures.

The peach tree has proved to be the most exciting feature of the plot. We [transplanted it in the snow](http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/2009/12/21/transferring-the-peach-in-severe-adverse-weather/) and had concerns for it's future but it has bounced back and covered itself in fruit. Each week I rush up to check how much they've grown and confirm that no one has nicked them yet.

They are looking particularly peachy at the moment but are still rock solid. This is my most eagerly anticipated crop, I can't wait to try it.
