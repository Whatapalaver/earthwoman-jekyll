Next weekend sees London's first light bulb amnesty.

Apparently you can take up to two traditional light bulbs into any London B&Q; store between the 11-13th January 2008 and get them replaced for free with a couple of long lasting, energy efficient bulbs.

Not a bad offer I think. Check out details at [london.gov.uk/lightbulbs](http://www.london.gov.uk/lightbulbs)
