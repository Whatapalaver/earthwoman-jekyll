I acquired a few off cuts of pond liner from the amazing [freecycle group](http://www.freecycle.org/) and after using them to suppress weeds for about 2 days, I decided I may as well get on and build a pond. I took a fairly haphazard approach to the design and was lucky that my sheet of rubber just about fit the hole I dug. I didn't spend enough time contemplating levels though, the water is tipping over the sides and I'm either going to have to do a little repair job or plant up an impromptu bog garden in the resulting swamp.

I'm chuffed to bits with the plot progress over the last month, thanks are due to the good digging help from my mum and dad and Shakti.

I spent 6 hours there today, pottering around, reading my latest book and waiting for the pond to fill. It wasn't all laid back of course, I did have to clear the space for the pond and then dig it out, and I dug up the strawberries and transplanted them for a second time in a month, this time under a mulch of excess pond liner, and I finished off my raspberry hedge. Phew, I feel the need to sit down again.

What am I going to do when its all clear?

My current allotment read is [Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: Our Year of Seasonal Eating](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0571233562?ie=UTF8&tag=warriorwomen-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0571233562)![Animal, Vegetable, Mineral](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=warriorwomen-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0571233562) by Barbara Kingsolver of The Poisonwood Bible fame. Its about her families year long experiment to eat only locally sourced produce, which in the most part means food they grew themselves. It's very interesting so far and poetically written. I was a bit ashamed to be reading it on my barren plot eating a packet of crisps and a bottle of ginger ale sourced from Sainsburys. I'll make amends soon enough and with any luck I'll be drinking my own ginger brew next weekend - although thats dependent on me finding a source of muslin so that I can filter the yeast out of my gloop.
