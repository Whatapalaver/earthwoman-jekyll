We're only getting alternate weekends down on the plot at the moment, so it's a great blessing when we manage to coincide with the good weather, although after 5 hours of meddling in the mud and sun this Saturday I was fit to drop. Good job we had an extended weekend to recover.

I spent most of those hours pottering in the greenhouse we resurrected on our last visit. It's just about hanging on in there but looks like a very well worn teddy, complete with stitching and bandages - I don't think I'll manage to squeeze another season out of the plastic covering.

I banked all the sides up (inside and out) with old and new grow bags to try and protect it from the ravages of the wind and then set to, planting 15 assorted tomato plants and experimenting with an array of self-watering gadgetry and fancy supports.

The first watering system I tried out was the "Growtube" but my bottle reservoir just evacuated its contents within the space of about 45 seconds and resulted in most of the contents of the grow bag spewing over the sides. I was reasonably happy with the alternative bottle attachment you can see in the right hand side of this photo. It at least held the water for the 5 hours I was watching it. So long as it hasn't got a permanent blockage I shall be happy.

While I was sweltering under the polythene, Lynn was out in the open, constructing stuff that actually has some sturdiness about it.

The plot won't know what hit it.

We now have a bean support system that doesn't look as though it will crack under the weight of the first two pods, a peculiarly creative broad bean "thingy" and a stretch of wind break that will offer further protection to the rapidly decaying greenhouse.

I'm feeling quite happy with the plot at the moment. We seem to have got on top of the situation and set ourselves up for a good growing season.

The challenge now will be to keep on top of the watering and find enough space, that hasn't already been colonised by the ubiquitous onion sets, to grow actual food. I've got 12 squash seedlings in the greenhouse but have no clue of where to put them, perhaps I need to get myself on the waiting list for a second, dedicated, squash plot.
