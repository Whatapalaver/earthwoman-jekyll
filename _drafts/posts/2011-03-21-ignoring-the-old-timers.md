Two successive weekends on the plot and I can officially declare the allotment season open. This weekend was particularly glorious and I may have even acquired a little sunburn.

I always get over excited at the first sign of spring sun and despite the old timers warning me that the soil is still too cold, I scatter my seeds and tubers with gay abandon.

This weekend was much warmer but I found it far too easy to sit on the bench, basking in the sun, and passing out instruction as Lynn continued with the digging and planted another 4 rows of spuds. My only contribution was a little raking and the planting of 100 onion sets.

As ever I've ordered far too many potatoes and I could easily fill the entire plot if we weren't interested in any other crops.

I was sent a copy of The Allotment Source Book by Caroline Foley a few months ago. With my new found gardening enthusiasm I've been tempted to pull it off the shelf and turn through the pages. It's a massive tome at 384 pages and quite unlike the usual vegetable gardening books on my bookcase. Although it does have a monthly what to do guide and an A-Z veg guide, I would say that at least half of the book is given over to inspiring ideas of the veg growing variety.

It has a scrap book feel to it and the most fabulous photos. I've enjoyed flicking through the book - it has left me feeling as though I've been on a reconnaissance tour through a series of allotment sites and I've picked up tips for new structures and swanky pea supports.

I was very impressed to see the step by step guide to making nettle rope. I've had a go at this on one of my foraging trips and the demonstration looks very thorough.
