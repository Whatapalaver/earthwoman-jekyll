Progress report for March.

March has been a wash out weather wise and we even managed a bit of snow. A little creative jiggery pokery with my annual leave arrangements has enabled me to make the most of the very occasional dry spell to get on the plot and the results have been satisfying:

- All spuds are now planted. Heaven nows how I am going to eat them all but that's a problem for June, not March.
- Copious quantities of broken paving slabs were collected from a freecyclist, a job that took the best part of a day due to me nursing the worlds worst hangover.
- Paths were laid a few days later when I finally recovered.
- Broad beans seem to be surviving despite doubtful glances from the old timers.
- Shakti seems to be doing wonders with the seedlings in her care and has happily turned her front room into my nursery.
- On the second to last day of March I completed digging the entire plot. Not one inch remains untouched. I am shattered but content and perhaps wondering what on earth I am to do with myself now.

March marks the end of my first 6 months with the plot so here's the before and after shot:
