So June has been and gone and I can't believe I managed to miss the summer solstice. I was pleased to discover while putting together this months - Month in Pictures, that I was at least on the plot on the 21st - sowing more carrots. If the summer solstice is also known as midsummers day, that would also suggest that I missed the whole of the first half of summer, I've been assuming we were still in spring - when does summer actually start?

June was a good month on the food front, the broad beans were finished with but were replaced at the end of the month by runner and borlotta beans. Spuds were worth digging up from the 2nd week, although I'd probably have got some earlier if I'd taken some anti slug measures.

Seeds germinated at break neck speed this month, it's worth remembering next year that I shouldn't stress too much about getting all my plants in early - they soon catch up.

I'm already planning next years seed order, I suppose it's a bit too early to send the order off but I've made my choices of squash, pea, bean and tomato seeds from the Real Seed company. I'm going more exotic next year and avoiding some of the poor choices from this year.

I'm not bothering with Feltham First next year, they may over winter well and crop early but they are gross. In fact I am wiping all smooth peas off the drawing board - only wrinklies will enter my seed box from now on. I think I could manage 3 rows of broad beans as well, I'll stagger two sowings of Aquadulce and then try something different for a late spring sowing.
