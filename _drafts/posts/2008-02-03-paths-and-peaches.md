Great weekend, the sort that requires another weekend to recover from though.

The widely forecast snow didn't rear its head in London, in fact Saturday was a gloriously sunny day. I was free in the afternoon so headed off to the plot with my newly delivered peach tree. I bought this from [Blackmoor Nurseries](http://www.blackmoor.co.uk/) and the variety, Avalon Pride, is apparently resistant to leaf curl. If I can plant it against a SW-erly wall I should be rewarded with juicy fruit some years hence.

My shed is approximately SW facing, if you are a glass half full person, so I've decided to train it as a fan underneath the bird box. This required some brave and ruthless pruning. The stump you see in the photo is the result of two days of nervous nibbling with the secateurs. It seems such a tragic waste to hack off hard grown branches, especially when the tree cost £25, I've already relegated about £10 quids worth to the incinerator.

Today wasn't such a great day, cold and flippin windy but I managed to get quite a lot done. You've got to love sheds, regardless of how bitter the day is, you've always got a little retreat. A perfect home from home. Everyone should have a strategically placed shed with a supply of tea bags and digestive biscuits, it's practically a human rights issue.

So I started with a bit of digging - I still haven't cleared that peculiar ridge of bindweed and couch grass roots that I mentioned a few weeks back, and then I chose to start building a path.

At the moment I seem to be wandering haphazardly across the plot, compacting the area I've already dug, so I need to add some order. I nicked the bricks from another pre-existing but almost buried path and will need to go on a hunt for suitable hardcore material before I can organise the whole plot properly.

After a couple of hours hard labour, it was back into the shed to start the sweet pea seeds off in the toilet rolls I've been collecting for months.

I don't get a huge amount of light through the glazed windows, so I hope they don't get too straggly before it is safe enough to send them outside to face the big bad world.

I'm using one of my old coke bottles as toilet roll specific watering device. It was a heck of a lot harder to construct than you'd imagine - I knocked a nail through the lid after a couple of severe bashes with the hammer but I had one hell of a job removing it again. The plastic on those lids must be about an inch thick!
