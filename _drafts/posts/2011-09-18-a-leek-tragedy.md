Today's trip to the allotment was a disaster of mythical proportions.

A plague of juicy maggots reduced an entire bed of leeks to this pitiful harvest.

I have to confess that I rarely do well with my leeks but I've never seen them as bad as this. They are completely peppered with holes, riddled with the maggots and turning to mush below the greenery.

Much wailing prevailed.

Having come back to my computer I have cheered myself up with a trip to soilman who has a whole page dedicated to [leek miseries](http://www.soilman.net/tag/leeks/). Also on my web search I found a tip which suggested that you cut the leeks down to soil level and wait for them to re-sprout. Too late for that now but it might have been worth the risk with a few of them, I've barely got enough for a leek and potato soup here.

I'm afraid I didn't do that, I like to save as much as I can for the compost heap but I'll regret it if the bugs flourish ready for next year.

I suspect it is the leek moth as I've found the perfect description on [this site](http://www.allotments.fsnet.co.uk/leekmoth.html "Leek moth"). It's description of the life-cycle of the leek moth includes the following:

> Adult moths overwinter in plant debris. As temperatures rise in the spring, the moths start to become active and egg laying begins in April and May.

Sounds like I've created them a home from home in the warm heap of plant debris. I wonder if I'm too late to go back and incinerate the pile of discarded leeks.

I'll be growing them under enviromesh next year. I had my carrots under enviromesh and for once I can be proud of a carrot harvest.
