I love these anenomes.

They are such gaudy, brash, little prima madonnas but they hold their tacky beauty to the bitter end. Even when the petals drop, I feel tempted to leave the dried out remains on the table top.

Unfortunately the pictured flowers came from M&S; and not my plot. I've scattered the anenome de caen bulbs all around my allotment but the growth so far looks a bit limp. I've never had success with these bulbs, the growth has always been half-hearted and any flowers that develop are devoured by black fly.

Has anyone out there had success with the flowers? What is the secret to nurturing a fine and dandy anemone plant? I'm suspecting growth hormone.
