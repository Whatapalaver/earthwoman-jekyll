Gordon Bennett, those weeds are growing like crazy.

I made an attempt on the optimistically named carrot bed and retrieved enough speedwell and thistles to fill a compost barrel. I also uncovered the carrot, previously [](https://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/2542173968/)presumed abducted.

It appears alive and well, unless it’s one of those annoying weeds that masquerade as the spitting image of a carrot.
