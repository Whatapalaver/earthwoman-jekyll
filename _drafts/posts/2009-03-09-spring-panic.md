Absolutely stunning spring morning, shamefully wasted away in bed, and then followed by an afternoon trip to the plot, accompanied by a flurry of soggy hail - my favourite.

I've slipped into my usual March panic. The year is galloping along and I feel as though I must be behind. Surely I should have seeds bursting from the ground by now. As it is I haven't even got round to sorting my seed packs into planting order.

If I bothered to check out last years progress I'd probably remind myself that there isn't really much advantage to be gained from planting early. The carrots never germinate and all late sown seeds come into there own in late April/early May. I've still got that white rabbit panic though: "I'm late , I'm late".

The purple sprouting broccoli has sprouted at last, the pigeon netting did the trick and I managed to pick a whole buckets worth of the delicious treats.
