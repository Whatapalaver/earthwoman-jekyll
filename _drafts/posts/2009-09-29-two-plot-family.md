We went to examine a vacant plot last week and came away having signed on the dotted line. I see before me a winter of heavy digging in an attempt to tame yet another South West London allotment.

It's only two years ago that I took over the plot at North Sheen. That plot was in a fair old state but the wonderfully light soil conditions meant that I was able to make impressive improvements day by day. This new plot is based on heavy clay soil so no doubt our rewards will be considerably slower.

It's quite an exciting time, daunting but full of promise. The fresh start is an ideal time to have a complete re-plan. I've listed all the veg that the kids are prepared to eat, added a few of our favourites and armed with a spreadsheet and a measuring tape, I ought to be able to make a highly productive strip. Planning isn't one of my strong points though, within the space of 5 minutes I managed to order the same seed from two different catalogues - I'll have to extend the leek bed.

Here are the initial photos from our first visit, it's a long thin plot of 5 rods. We can't actually start work before the 1st October, which effectively means that D-Day is set for Saturday. I better book the massage session now.
