I couldn't wait any longer so pulled the [anxiety causing carrot](https://www.earthwoman.co.uk/2008/06/02/don%e2%80%99t-panic-carrot-returns/) out of the ground this weekend. It was completely blemish free and was chomped almost immediately - delightful, although excessively expensive.

Out of the 3 packs of seeds I sowed in early spring, I managed to persuade 5 carrots to grow to maturity which can hardly be described as successful. Fortunately the June sown carrots appear to have germinated at a promising rate so I should be able to recoup some of my investment.

I checked out my household spending records yesterday and discovered that my grocery expenditure has dropped by £150 each quarter since I took on the plot. I barely buy any vegetables anymore and I should hope that for the next couple of months I ought to be able to go supermarket cold turkey. Good news in this time of spiraling food prices.
