I escaped to the coast for most of the bank holiday to get some essential [swimming prep](http://www.warriorwomen.co.uk/2008/08/24/north-sea-swimming-lessons/) under my belt, but today I was free to catch up on some much needed admin on the plot. All the spuds have been dug and bagged, the mid summer peas have been ripped up and the gasping tomatoes were watered.

The outdoor tomatoes have been decimated by blight but I haven't dealt with them yet because I'm not sure what to do. Ideally I'd burn them but my arson skills are limited and I have a whopping great mound of blight invested potatoes haulms to deal with first.

I had a little helper on the plot today. He watered my spinach and kohl rabi and then emptied my sack of spuds as I tried to fill it. I boiled up a delightful cob of corn but he wasn't interested and opted instead for a couple of yellow french beans and a load of shelled peas.

It feels great to share real food with little kids, so many people in cities haven't a flipping clue where food comes from or what it looks like. This one now knows the joy of a freshly podded pea.
