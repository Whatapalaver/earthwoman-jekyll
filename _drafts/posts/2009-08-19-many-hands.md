Summer holidays have been decidedly child oriented this year, so you have to grab your allotment opportunities when you can.

Despite having two car loads full of soggy and tired teenagers I managed to persuade them that my plot was the perfect stop off before heading on to our barbeque destination. That's a tricky sale but they were all remarkably enthused by the whole experience. They rushed around discovering weird bin lid sized squashes, picking rhubarb and scavenging for sweetcorn. I was particularly happy with the potato picking extravaganza. I remember that as a childhood joy and loved sharing it.

It's a shame we had to rush off, I actually had to pull youfs away from weeding my beetroot - what a waste of labour!

We went back this weekend without the gang of helpers and had to pick the remaining spuds alone.

The King Edwards seemed to do the best, all the others suffered with quite extensive scab. What causes that?

All my tomato plants have been ripped out now, the blight got them really badly but strangely it doesn't appear to have spread to the spuds. I whipped them out nonetheless, it's not going to be long.
