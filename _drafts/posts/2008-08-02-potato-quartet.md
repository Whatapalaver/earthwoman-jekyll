My Dad has been hoping to use me as a blight early warning station, assuming that I'd be hit before the spores were carried northward in the breeze, but as it turned out he was able to alert me first. The fungal foray started in Yorkshire.

To be on the safe side I've dug up most of my remaining rows of spuds and bagged them up in hessian sacks.

From front to back we have, King Edwards, Maris Peer, Kerrs Pink and Charlotte.

The King Edwards are terribly scabby so I might not plant them again next year, although I will do a soil test first to see if I need to increase the acidity levels in my trenches. The Charlottes were the most successful, blemish free and delicious but both of the others are tasty too.
