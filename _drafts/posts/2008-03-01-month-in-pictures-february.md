Progress report for February.

The weather was remarkably mild and I enjoyed a good few sunny weekends on the plot.

- The [peach was planted](https://www.earthwoman.co.uk/archives/34) and tentatively pruned to within an inch of it's life.

- Paths and a seed bed were constructed in a fashion.

- The [Hellebore flowered beautifully](https://www.earthwoman.co.uk/archives/35) and provided a lovely welcome to all frogs that were considering setting up residence in the pond but none came.

- The [broad beans were exposed to the elements](https://www.earthwoman.co.uk/archives/37) as they were growing too big for their toasty covering.

- The [peas were staked](https://www.earthwoman.co.uk/archives/39).

- First row of spuds were planted - Swift.

- Aubergines and tomatoes were sown and promptly shipped off to Shaktis for nurturing on the window ledge.
