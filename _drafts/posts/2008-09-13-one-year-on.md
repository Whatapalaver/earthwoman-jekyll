One year on there is a real sense of the growing season ebbing away, quite a different feel to [last September](https://www.earthwoman.co.uk/2007/09/) when everything was just starting. The weather was quite different too, scorching last year vs sodden this year.

There are a few similarities, I'm back to digging and I'm planting strawberries again, I've even got another pile of weeds forming but this summer it doesn't look like the heap will ever dry out sufficiently to set it aflame.

The strawberry bed was a mass of tangles, strawberry runners twirled around bindweed stems and I felt it was time to have a clean up. I'm probably a little late actually but I'm sure they'll be happier with some breathing room now. It also gave me chance to clear out the last remaining patch of bindweed hiding underneath the pond liner.

Here's the yearly progress shot from the water butt - anticlockwise: Sept 07, Mar 08, Aug 08, Sept 08.
