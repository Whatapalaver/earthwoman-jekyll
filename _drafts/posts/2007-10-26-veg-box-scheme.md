How pretty is this little delivery?

Following my thwarted search for local food last weekend, I thought I'd try out a veg box scheme. This little box came from the [organic delivery company](http://www.organicdelivery.co.uk), who apparently source local organic produce from the Covent Garden fruit and veg market. They have an evening delivery in my neck of the woods every friday evening which is jolly convenient.

I completely messed up with my order online but they gave me a call to sort it all out and still managed to fit me in for this evenings delivery - so no complaints there. The delivery went a little awry though, the box was left outside no 22 while my flat is no 23. The two numbers are at diagonal opposites in the block so I imagine the delivery guy just got fed up searching for me. Anyway, alls well that ends well, I got to meet another neighbour - a lovely lady from no 16 who spotted the produce and took it upon herself to re-unite it with its home.

I got a box of eggs at the same time and discovered that I can supposedly identify the farm or origin from the label. My farm is 0-402 but I can't for the life of me find a website that will convert codes to farm addresses, so I have to just trust that it was local - not ideal.
