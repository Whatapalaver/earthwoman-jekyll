A long, long, time ago, [easygardener](http://greenforks.com/2008/04/e-for-excellent/) gave me a very welcome award - the E for Excellent award and recently Rhiannon from [GreenPatch](http://rhiannon-greenpatch.blogspot.com/2008/07/award.html) spoiled me further with the Arte y Pico award.

Now it's time to pass these treats on to some great bloggers who have entertained me over the last few months.

Apparently I can choose 10 bloggers to recognise but that seems like an awful lot so we'll see how the list pans out:

- [Soilman](http://www.soilman.uk.com/soilmans_allotment_blog/) \- for his down to earth style, who manages to educate and entertain in almost equal measures.
- [Nigey](http://nigeygreen.wordpress.com/) \- who understands my bodging antics.
- [Faites-Simple](http://faites-simple.blogspot.com/) \- beautifully written, interesting posts. I love following this one for the rural escape plan.
- [Carrots and Kids](http://carrotsandkids.blogspot.com/) \- pick a post any post and you'll love as I do.
- [The Big Sofa](http://thebigsofa.wordpress.com/) \- another of my favourite blogs and we are practically neighbours!
- [Someone else's Kitchen](http://someoneelseskitchen.blogspot.com/) - Amanda has just moved over to Canada and now lives life on a mammoth scale, see the [toilet rolls](http://someoneelseskitchen.blogspot.com/2008/07/giant-toilet-roll-invasion.html) or [greenhouse](http://someoneelseskitchen.blogspot.com/2008/07/greenhouse-divorce.html).
- [An Artists Garden](http://artistsgarden.wordpress.com/) \- for the sheer beauty of it, but what do you expect with a title like that?
