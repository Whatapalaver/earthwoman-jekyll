For Christmas this year I got a couple of packs of mushroom "seed" or more accurately, packs of wooden dowells impregnated with mushroom mycelium.

I went up to Yorkshire for a few days so I split them with my Dad and we had some fun trying to bash the little plugs into some freshly cut logs. We've got two varieties, oyster and shitake, can't say I'm that fond of shitake but I'm hoping to acquire a dessicator before they crop, they should be pretty useful in soups after I've dried them out.

Back home I sunk them in the ground just in front of the shed, where I hope they'll get sufficient shade to be happy. They apparently crop best in October but I can't imagine they'll take that long to issue some fruit.

I can't remember which is which now.

While I was visiting my parents, I also raided their established pond and nicked some weed, pond water and a water lily. I think the allotment frog population should be jolly happy with the new residence.
