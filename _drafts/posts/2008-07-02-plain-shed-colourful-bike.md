Thanks for all the graffiti advice in the comments to the last post.

I took the train to the plot at the weekend and discovered that every single flat surface (mostly sheds) facing the platform had been scrawled over with the silver spray paint. It looked a bit grim and so I decided that the shed should be re-painted. It will probably take a few coats as the spray paint is heavy duty stuff, but as I had to go out and buy a new tub of paint, I have plenty to go around.

They can come back as often as they like now, I'll be ready for em.

They didn't cause any more damage by the way - all my crops were left intact which is a blessing.

I picked up my new Brompton from the fantastic [Wizz Bike](https://www.wizzbike.com/) this evening and went straight to the plot to photograph the new machine in amongst the potatoes. The foliage just sets the colours off!

I was surprised to find that the beans are ready to start cropping, I had a trangia full of Borlotta and runner beans for my tea, shamefully mixed with a packet of curry flavoured supernoodles.
