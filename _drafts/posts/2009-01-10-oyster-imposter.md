I did a quick flit to the plot this weekend to harvest roast ingredients and to rescue the developing mushrooms.

I was surprised to find a beautiful chestnut fungus occupying the place where my [foetal oyster mushroom](https://www.earthwoman.co.uk/2008/12/25/sprout-torment/) had appeared only days before. I obviously got my logs labelled incorrectly and these were actually the shitakes.

I picked a cabbage that was frozen through to the core. I probably shouldn't have picked it in that state, the leaves were practically transparent. It cooked up pretty well though and the flavour didn't seem to be impaired by my impatience.

I pulled a couple of the shitakes as well but then forgot to add them to my pork chops. They are still on my work surface now so I hope they dehydrate themselves before going mouldy, so I can use them for some exotic dish that I may rustle up in the future.
