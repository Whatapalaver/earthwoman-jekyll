I haven't been down to the plot for a few days so there was a good quantity of produce waiting for my arrival:

Doesn't that look delicious? In addition I filled a canvas sack with more beans and a stack of chard but it didn't look quite so photogenic.

I'm going to make [herbed summer squash and potato torte](http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/07/herbed-summer-squash-and-potato-torte/), a recipe that came from SmittenKitten, the best food blog I have come across so far. Honestly, you should take a look, it's left me excited about cooking. I've made the irresistible [lime meltaways](http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/08/key-lime-meltaways/) already (see todays lunch) and will be trying out the [chocolate hazelnut biscotti](http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/07/chocolate-hazelnut-biscotti/) just as soon as my new food mixer arrives.

But I'm digressing, here are the questions:

Is this ready to pick?

It's an aubergine obviously, and I'm sure you'll want to know the variety but I forgot to look at the seed pack, in fact I'm not sure the seed pack still exists. Shakti insists it's one of those especially special thin and delicious aubergines that I have never heard of, but I suspect she just wants me to start picking them so she can have one. I was expecting them to swell to mammoth proportions at some point. Anybody got any views on aubergines?

Final question is, what is this?

This is a massive plant that has self-seeded in the entrance to my green house and is doing a fine job of blocking my access. I let it grow out of curiosity and now it has turned into my most productive squash. Trouble is, I don't know what it is. I'm wondering if it might be butternut squash as I had plenty of seeds kicking around and it is shaped correctly even if it is the wrong colour.

Anyone know if butternuts start off green, or is it a summer squash that needs to be devoured right now?
