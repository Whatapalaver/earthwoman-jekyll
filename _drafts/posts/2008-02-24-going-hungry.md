I gave myself a day off the running so I could enjoy another leisurely session on the plot. I carried on where I left off yesterday and weeded most of the remaining beds. The peas are getting a bit lanky as well so I stuck some titchy sticks in to keep them on the straight and narrow til the weather becomes more stable and I can remove the mesh cover. There were quite a few empty stations where the peas either didn't germinate or were swiped by meeces so I popped in a few spare seeds, hopefully they'll come along soon enough and pad out the row.

Before I came down to the allotment this morning, I passed by Shakti's for breakfast. She posed the question "If we ran out of money tomorrow, what would we live off from your plot?" About 3 months ago she sowed the pea seeds that I supported above and can't quite believe that we aren't eating fresh garden peas yet. I don't thinks she's altogether too impressed with the DIY food malarkey, life is just a little more instantaneous down at Tescos.

On arrival I surveyed the crops with a hungry mind but was somewhat disillusioned. I think the only currently edible produce is cabbage and some other critter already seems to have eaten way more than I will ever get to enjoy. Don't these look like a pitiful bunch?

So in answer to the question, I think we would survive for about a week on limp cabbage leaf. Life would then get tough unless I could find an inspiring recipe for roasted bind weed and couch grass roots. I've got enough of those to keep us cooking on gas til the peas start cropping!

More seeds went in today as well, I've sown half a row of carrots - early nantes that came free with "Grow It" magazine and a full row of parsnips. Both have gone in the space I cleared yesterday by removing the salad leaves.

I've also started a batch of aubergine and tomato seeds in individual modules. My flat is no go zone for anything green, within 24 hrs every living form of plant life collapses in an irradiated heap. Quite concerning but I seem to cope unscathed. Anyway, the seeds need to live somewhere warmer and brighter than the shed, but safer than my flat so I've sent them to germinate at Shakti's house. She accepted them willingly so I'll see what other delicate little seedlings I can pass into her care. She'll soon discover the joys of DIY food growing.
