I was intrigued yesterday to see a recipe for a shed beer fridge in [Allotment Growing Diary Plus](http://www.allotment.org.uk/garden-diary/264/rain-weeds-allotment-beer-fridge/), and as it's my birthday today I thought it was a fine excuse for enjoying cold beer on the plot.

The idea is that the terracotta pot cools following evaporation of the absorbed water.

It certainly seemed to work, within an hour the pot was very cool but I made the mistake of starting with warm beer. I was too impatient to wait for the full process had to make do with coolish, luke warm beer.

I've left a couple of beers in there and topped the tray up before I left so we'll see how long it works for. Maybe there will be an icy beer waiting for me after work tomorrow.

And here's a gratuitous flower picture. I'm so happy with these dahlias, I grew them from seed and never imagined they'd be so successful.
