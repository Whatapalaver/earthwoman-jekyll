We were up bright early to make the most of the late summer sunshine and to raid the allotment association shop of all its goodies.

After directing mum to the worst heap of weeds seen outside of the amazonian rainforest, dad and I headed off in search of cheap sheds. We arrived back a couple of hours later, with a fake shed box type thing, and found a somewhat exhausted and sunburned mother.

Here they are, modeling in front of the shedbox - very Richmond Gothic.

This was a really hard working day, we dug over most of this half of the plot, dad poisoned the other half and I planted myself a crop of plastic bottles.
