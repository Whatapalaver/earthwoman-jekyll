Another glorious weekend and I managed to sneak two full days on the plot. I was supposed to be out on my long run on Sunday afternoon but I'm finding it increasingly hard to drag myself away from the shed. With weather like this I can stretch out on my bench with my feet on a sack of manure, my back leaning gently against my peach and my face basking in the sun.

nNo sun bathing for these coy little beauties, they spend their entire lives looking at the ground, I wonder what made them so shy.

It wasn't a completely lazy weekend, I spent most of the time digging and now there's only a small strip left to go before the entire plot will have been given the once over.

I also prepared a seed bed. I really don't know why I keep being attracted towards construction jobs, I must be the worlds worst DIY'er. I gathered my scrap planks, chopped to them to size and then nailed them together into a frame of sorts before knocking it and the stakes into the freshly dug ground. As soon as I took the hammer to the stakes the whole frame decided to blow apart. 30 bent nails later I managed to get it to stay together for long enough to step away from the disaster area.

I intend to use it as a stale seed bed for starting off my cabbage and leek plants. I'm not sure how well it well it will do as the shed casts quite a shadow and it only really catches the sun from about 1pm onwards but we'll see.

My neighbour gave me a good bag of jerusalem artichokes to take home with me. I don't think I will bother growing any, what a flipping faff they are to peel! I made a carrot and JA soup which was ok but not special enough to repeat, I'll try roasting the few I have left and see if this leads to any sort of culinary epiphany.
