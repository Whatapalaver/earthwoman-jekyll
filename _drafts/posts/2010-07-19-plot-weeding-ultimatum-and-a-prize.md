The committee ladies accosted us at the gates and threw down an ultimatum. Apparently our plot needed weeding and weeding quick. We had 3 days.

They then told us that we had won the best new comers award - no congratulations implied.

Apparently we were now in the running for best new comers in the whole of Croydon. The committee had seemed slightly pre-occupied by the pan-Croydon allotment competition for a few weeks. A fancy new pergola has been erected by the entrance and bee hives have been introduced into a tiny corner.

Everyone has been instructed to tidy up and now it was our turn. All eyes on our plot.

We thanked them in shame and scooted off to de-weed our flower bed.

In the privacy of our own plot we allowed a little smugness to sneak through. Lynn insisted that it must have been her onions what done it while I maintain that it can only be the peaches of wonder.

Here's a quick tour of our award winning plot.
