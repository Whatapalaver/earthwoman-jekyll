The weekend was scheduled for the installation of the guttering and water butt, a task I'd handed over to Lynn but not before I had passed on the benefit of my [huge and heroically unsuccessful experiences](https://www.earthwoman.co.uk/2008/04/19/purple-throbbing-digitalis/). I've been spouting tales of woe for the last week, predicting DIY disasters of monumental proportions and just to add to the pressure I thought I'd invite my parents down to witness the whole event.

Of course my parents are [renowned troopers](https://whatapalaver.co.uk/2008/05/wot-no-grandkids/) in the allotment world so I might also have hoped to benefit a little from their digging prowess and work ethic as well.

This shot nicely captures Lynn's fear as she spots the kinky boots I bought my mum a couple of Christmases ago, I like to think she's wondering desperately how she can backtrack and remove wellington boots from the xmas wishlist she left me with.

Too late though I'm afraid.

I've been revisiting an old book "Companion Planting" by Gertrud Franck and it triggered a little obsession with the mass planting of spinach seeds. I sourced a bulk supplier, [Seeds By Size](https://www.seeds-by-size.co.uk/), awaited delivery of my 25,000 spinach seeds and then waited for the general mocking and guffawing from the children to die down, before sitting down myself and wondering if I'd gone ever so slightly nuts.

I am reasonably content that the mocking will die down when they find plate-fulls of slimey green stuff turning up day after to day but between then and now there is a lot of planting to do.

Luckily my Dad was quite prepared to get stuck in there and start me off with the first row.

I think the general idea with the spinach planting is to cut and leave in-situ as a mulch or green manure but I'll worry about the specifics later.

Heading back to the water butt, I'm afraid there is very little left to say.

It was disappointingly uneventful.

The guttering was erected in moments, Lynn and my mum sorted the trajectory without recourse to swearing and the whole thing was dressed up like a work of art before I had chance to get my hands dirty.

My hands may have remained relatively clean but I didn't let my folks get away with anything easy.

All in all they transplanted two fruit trees, dug the grotty front patch, planted a rhubarb crown, transplanted a row of spring cabbage, commenced the sowing of the 25,000 and demonstrated a bit of synchronised digging.

I did give them a cup of tea though.
