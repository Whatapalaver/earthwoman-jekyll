The title applies to me and not the plot which continues to be satisfyingly productive as todays steamer contents will confirm.

I had a phone call today from my parents who were happy yet a little puzzled to find my blog mentioned in the Saturday edition of the Telegraph under the section: [Best Allotment Blogs](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/main.jhtml?xml=/gardening/2008/04/25/garden-allotment-blogs125.xml#1). The puzzlement was not so much due to the broadsheet recognition but rather the manner in which I was described - "Earthwoman is a working mother who posts beautiful pics and regular updates on her plot."

Now I would like to reassure my folks that I have not been hiding any grandkids from them and as a note to any new readers I have to say I am resolutely childless, but I do post quite nice pics.
