A virus of some sort is doing the rounds of my body at the moment so I'm not fit for much, but it's hard to let the weekend go by without a trip to the lotty. It's been so windy recently that I needed to see how the uncovered broad beans were doing and water the sweet pea seedlings.

I dragged my aching limbs down to the plot and on arrival promptly collapsed on my shed stool. Some time later I went to check on the beans. Assorted buckets from goodness knows where were wind strewn across my plot but thankfully the beans seemed to be holding themselves together.

I was pleased to see a huge bee moving hurriedly from flower to flower as well, good job I removed the fleece or those flowers may never have set.

The only other thing I managed to do was to fill a few rows of modules with potting compost and assorted exotic seed: sweet peppers, chilli peppers, mixed lettuce, basil and a couple of dahlia types scrounged from a Bridlington allotment.

These have been packed off to live in Shakti's flat as well, I'm doing my best to convert her place into a nursery.
