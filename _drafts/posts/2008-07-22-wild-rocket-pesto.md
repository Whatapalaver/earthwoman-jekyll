I have a substantial glut of ever so slightly over the hill rocket, last year I attempted to use it up by boiling the rocket but I won't be making that mistake again. Yesterday I thought I'd risk a handful in a batch of home made pesto.

[Eliane](https://faites-simple.blogspot.com/2008/06/jam-tomorrow.html) recommended The New Penguin Cookery book a while ago, and on the basis of her review I invested in it. It is indeed a damn fine book and has a recipe for assorted pestos including a rocket and walnut version. Having read and absorbed the details I then proceeded to ignore the instructions - a dodgy tendency of mine.

My version went something along the lines of a light grab of pine kernals pounded with 3 cloves of garlic, and an equal amount of basil and rocket, also bashed into submission. No walnuts because I don't like them and no Parmesan because I forgot about it. I did add a couple of very stingy slithers of Manchego which were kicking around the back of the fridge and a small dollop of olive oil.

Very tasty - I served it with gnocchi.
