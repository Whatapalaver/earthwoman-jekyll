Well the "greenhouse" is still in one piece but is arousing amused glances on the plot. Quite a number of people have let me know that they won't be at all surprised to see it floating above their patch like a tomato laden hot air balloon.

I got a few really helpful comments to my last post, it seems both [Easygardener](https://greenforks.com/) and [Kethry](https://kethry.wordpress.com/) have learnt hard lessons with similar contraptions. Just to confirm, the frame is slightly submerged under the soil as is the excess polythene and I have now weighted this down further with a grow bag on each side. There are also 4 guy ropes attempting to hold the whole thing together and a number of clips holding the polythene to the frame.

Although it sounds super secure, I spent a bit of time in there today rearranging all the young plants from the front room nursery and gave myself one hell of a fright everytime one of the high speed trains whizzed past. The whole contraption feels as though it rises a couple of inches from the ground and then slams back down again. All the clips seem to pop off the frame as this happens and I've already retrieved 6 from the pond. If I had a bit more space I'd be tempted to go around the outside and bank the sides with growbags as well.

I've made the mental note to dismantle it before winter and if its still usable come next year I'll locate it away from the railway line.

It is going to be much more of a hassle to deal with the opening and closing of the door. I've left it closed for now as I want to ease the plants gently into life outside, I'm thinking to nip to the plot tomorrow though and open it. From then on in I'm hoping it will be ok to leave the door permanently open. I've clearly got a lot to learn about undercover gardening.
