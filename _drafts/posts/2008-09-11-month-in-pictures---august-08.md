[![Month in Pictures - August 2008](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3293/2818526099_d502765260.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/2818526099/)

Despite the grotty wet weather, August still flourished and I spent almost all of my gardening time harvesting crops. Can't complain about that but it does mean I failed to sow any overwintering crops, hopefully September sown spring cabbages will still be productive.

Blight inevitably struck towards the middle of the month so I pulled up all the spuds up and kept my fingers crossed for the health of the greenhouse tomatoes.

With the major crops out, and the blight spreading across the outdoor tomatoes the plot began to look a bit tatty towards the end of the month. Shame really but I suppose that's the way with gardening, its time to start looking forward to the view of freshly turned soil.
