Well there was no eviction notice tacked to the front of the shed so I may start to relax now. Mind you it was so windy today that any notice would have blown away, I was surprised the shed hadn't taken off in fact.

Check out the laminate flooring!

Despite the horrendous weather (Dad take note - your weather forecasting is not to be trusted), I enjoyed a little pottering on the plot. I managed to plant out the new Spartan apple tree, sort the compost and do a bit of hoeing between the onions and garlic.

Of course more time was spent inside the shed, looking out and pondering on the intricacies of life. I need a chair now and perhaps a kettle, you need to be comfortable to ensure high quality philosophising.
