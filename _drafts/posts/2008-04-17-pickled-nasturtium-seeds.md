A long time ago I read somewhere that nasturtium seeds can be pickled and used as a replacement caper. I love capers but don't feel so upbeat about the price of the tiny little jars so I've been wanting to try out this cheapskate trick for ages.

I've got a few plants started in the front room nursery and have just scattered a few more seeds around the plot today. Nasturtiums are a really useful plant, they are beautifully gaudy, attract blackfly like you wouldn't believe - thereby saving the broad beans from suffocation by the black beasties and the leaves add a peppery pungent taste to salads. If the pickling trick works, nasturtiums could easily make it into my top 5 desirable plant list.

Here's the recipe I'm going to try:

Collect as many green nasturtium seeds as you can muster - you pick these after the flowers have dropped but before they dry out, soak them overnight in a salty brine and then drop them into the boiled and cooled pickling concoction. I'll keep these in jars and shove them in the fridge but may update the recipe and storage instructions once I learn some pickling techniques.

- 1 mug white wine vinegar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced
- A few slices of lemon
- 1 bay leaf
- Pinch of mustard seeds
- 2 cloves garlic
- 6 peppercorns
