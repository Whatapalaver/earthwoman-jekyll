I've just been taking a look at the google earth image of my plot. I was wondering if my attempts to improve the surface of my tiny portion of the Earth were visible to the man in the moon yet.

It seems like google haven't updated their satellite images since around November 07 as the shed wasn't included but a fair amount of weed clearance is noticeable.

The other point of interest is that someone or something saw fit to relocate the Angel of the North slap bang in the middle of the plot just while the satellite flew over and said cheese. How strange.
