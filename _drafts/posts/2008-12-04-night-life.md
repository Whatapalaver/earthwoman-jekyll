I've been finding it difficult to find the time to get down to the plot recently, but faced with the prospect of yet another meal of tinned mushroom soup, I thought the time had come to rescue some of the remaining winter roots.

Armed with 4 high power bike torches I headed down to the allotment to spook myself in the gloaming.

My helmet lamp is quite bright so I left it on to dig amongst the carrot beds and for ferreting amongst the brocolli in search of early shoots.

My tea is looking more promising tonight.
