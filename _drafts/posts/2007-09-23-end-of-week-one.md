My parents are heading back to Yorkshire today but we were up early enough to cram in a quick trip to the lotty. We needed to see if the shed contraption was still in existence and construct a brassica protecting cloche. Talking to a few locals on the site yesterday indicated that my biggest threat was going to come from pigeons, so huge netting contraptions are required.

My mum can't resist the urge to dig when she's spots a weedy patch so the trip was extended as she attacked the last remaining heap. Over the last few days we've only managed to escape from the allotment by whining insistently until my mum finally gives in and hands over the fork. Anyone with digging requirements would do well to try and attract my mum to their plot!

Me and dad filled the time by creating another architectural wonder and planting a few rows of onion sets. I've also snuck a row of rocket under the enviromesh - I had a small bag left over from my last allotment days, not sure I can hold out too much hope for a massive of crop from year 2001 seeds though.

All in all, I think it's been an incredibly successful first week. My folks have been relentless labourers and shown that weedy patch absolutely no mercy. I couldn't have hoped to have any crops planted this year if it wasn't for their help.
