It's been pouring with rain fairly solidly for last 3 days but perversely I had to go down to the plot this evening to do some watering. That's the trouble of having some crops under cover.

The plot looked satisfyingly lush and the seed heads were majestic.

I left absolutely soaked but satisfied with my first picking of tomatoes and a healthy bag of runner beans.
