[![Month in Pictures - December 2008](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3083/3131766626_6c45a6a40a.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/3131766626/)

Life dried off a little for December and I managed to get down to the plot quite a few times.

The grotty dark nights resulted in a couple of torchlit digging sessions but I also found myself shamed into a day of weeding after passing by on the train and noticing the big blocks off lush green weeds where the onions were supposed to be thriving.

The chard is still dazzling passers by with its jazzy, party coloured, stems. I think the pink is particularly fetching but the orange doesn't seem to withstand the frost as well as the other shades.

There's been quite a lot of frost already which has probably sweetened up my swedes and done wonders for the brussels. The bracing wind doesn't have a lot going for it though, it has shredded my polythene greenhouse and although I've patched it up and folded it away in the shed, I don't hold out much hope for it lasting another season. I hope Wilkinsons survive the economic downturn at least until the summer, so that I can buy another one.

The wind also lifted a big patch of felt off my shed roof but fortunately Lynn is a roofer par excellence and shimmied up on top and sorted the job out with style. Given the number of nails used, there is not a chance that it will be shifting again, it'll stand up to hurricane Katrina should it need to.
