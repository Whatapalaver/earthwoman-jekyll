I\'ve uncovered a few fruit bushes and some scraggy strawberry plants so if I can clear a small corner these can be nurtured for another growing season.\r\n\r\nSo me and the new fork were introduced to the soil for the first time. It\'s pretty dusty stuff and I inhaled a good load of it as the wind blew in the general direction of my face every time I turned it. I bet this will be good for onions though, I\'m looking forward to growing some prize winning, weighty bulbs this year, in contrast to my usual pickling size specimens.\r\n<p style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/1392755747/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1009/1392755747_000073b9d3.jpg" alt="Bindweed Roots" border="0" height="388" width="303" /></a></p>\r\nCheck out the bindweed roots in the tilth though. God damn its vicious stuff! There is as much under the soil as there was on the surface. In fact there\'s probably more. I\'ve patiently listened to two old timers inform me that the only way to remove such pernicious weeds is to double dig to the depth of 5 foot, taking care to remove every single last shred of root as you go. Let me just say - this is not going to happen.\r\n\r\nMuch as I would like to be organic, I am going to go back to my chemist routes and employ some science. Roundup TM will be invited onto the plot for one weekend only, to decimate anything with a leaf. I\'ll then spend the rest of the year feeling guilty and trying to pretend I have organic principles, but at least I\'ll have some time to plant stuff!\r\n\r\nSo a little progress was made today, actual cultivation is in evidence and the heap of weeds is growing at an alarming rate.

Hopefully I\'ll find a source of spring cabbage plants before its too late as well. Oh and I also fancy installing a raspberry fence which is another autumnal task.

Can\'t hide from the seasons when you\'re gardening though.\r\n\r\nI paced the plot out today and it seems I have a 40ft * 40ft plot - jolly handy having foot sized trainers.

Nettle roots are amazing - such wiry yellow critters - a complete pain to remove but I bet they\'d make a great clothes dye.\r\n\r\nI am really excited by the compost heap windfall, I love compost and will have a production line going in no time.\r\n\r\nAfter de-weeding (fingers crossed) the edge, I transplanted the raspberry canes that my dad donated, to make a fruity fence alongside the railway track. I also shifted the plum tree even though I should probably have waited til next month.\r\n\r\nMy new neighbours are jolly friendly and offered me spuds if I could be bothered to dig them. As this is just about my favourite harvesting task of all (after pea podding) I was delighted and we had a little bag of what I think were Pink Fir Apples to see us through the rest of the week.\r\n\r\nBack home the ginger beer plant seems to be slacking a bit. I think its just too darn cold in my flat and the yeast has gone to sleep. It created a few more bubbles after adding sugar today and yesterday as its a lot warmer and I\'m wondering if I should just carry on feeding it for another week or just get on and bottle it.

I wouldn\'t start it yet of course, the allotment hasn\'t really had a chance to start supporting a healthy appetite, but it\'s never too late to start researching my options. On Sunday I thought I would head off to the lotty by way of the local farmers market to source some locally laid eggs, only it seems the local farmers market has been transplanted - so thats the end of the easy option.\r\n\r\nI looked in on the neighborhood butcher who seemed to have a good supply of eggs. I read all his labels for evidence of origin but they didn\'t go beyond "from a farm" and "free range",  which didn\'t pinpoint them to any place close. I suppose I could have gone in and grilled him on his sources but this is supposed to be a local food project and not a learn-how-to-speak-to-complete-strangers sort of project. I\'m beginning to think that communication may be the only way forward though, even the internet is being uncharacteristically unhelpful.\r\n\r\nToday I opted to explore the newly opened organic/herbal type health food shop for local food options. Not much luck in there either. They sold supplements of one form an another, which I would hope to be surplus to requirements in any healthy eating plan, some New Zealand honey, which doesn\'t sound so local and then a load of soya produce, which I\'m now led to believe is an evil industry responsible for wholesale habitat destruction. Not that I know what I\'m talking about, it\'s all way too political for my tiny mind but I\'m sure soya isn\'t a local produce anyway.\r\n\r\nI was looking out for ingredients for soda bread as inspired by <a href="http://bean-sprouts.blogspot.com/2007/10/soda-bread-recipe.html">Beansprouts</a>, so needed milk, yoghurt and wholemeal flour. I picked up the flour from the herbal shop but they didn\'t do milk or yoghurt of the dairy variety. I could easily have given in to the lure of Waitrose but that is surely to easy. Instead I opted for ye olde corner shoppe, no idea where he gets his products from but he did have all the items I required. My butter choices were either Holland or New Zealand again, the New Zealand butter claimed it came from happy cows but having travelled half way to NZ I know it aint even nearly local, Holland on the other hand isn\'t too far away.\r\n\r\nOn my way home (via the pub) I had a little think about my butter purchase. I have it good authority that you even get cows in London, admittedly East London, but London nontheless, so shouldn\'t that mean I can get hold of East London butter? More searching required.\r\n\r\nFinally, its time to turn my attention towards beer. I\'m fortunate enough to live opposite a brewery. Unfortunately it ships out Budweiser, but, hypothetically speaking, if I were to drink Bud from the pub opposite the brewery, could I feel confident that it hadn\'t actually been shipped from Mortlake to the US of A and then back to Mortlake again?\r\n\r\nLocal eating and drinking is going to be tough and I need to build up a bit of knowledge before I tackle this - I wouldn\'t want to starve.', 'Local Food - How Hard Can It Be?', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'local-food-how-hard-can-it-be', '', '', '2007-10-22 18:39:13', '2007-10-22 17:39:13', '', 0, 'http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/archives/15', 0, 'post', '', 4, '');

The two numbers are at diagonal opposites in the block so I imagine the delivery guy just got fed up searching for me.

However, I had a number of tasks that needed to be ticked off the list so I headed off early to beat the inevitable rain.\r\n\r\nI took the plot on rather too late in the year to sow any winter crops, so early in the month I ordered a selection of plug plants from <a href="http://www.organicplants.co.uk/">Delfland Nurseries</a>. Royal Mail scuppered my horticultural hopes when they vaporised my plants somewhere in the midst of their industrial action. Thankfully the nursery had a few more plants left and kindly sent me out a replacement. I may be about 3 weeks too late but my lovely little organic plants had arrived and they needed to go in the ground pronto.\r\n\r\nMy organic plug plants comprised: 6 spring cabbages, 6 calabrese and 12 "Bright lights" Ruby Chard. In addition to these little head-starters I had 157 bulbs to plant around the pond. Bulbs always look so easy when they are packaged up and I get carried away with the bulk purchase value but planting 157 bulbs is no mean feet. My pond is not so big either and the planting may now be a little over dense. I suppose spring will tell.\r\n<p style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/1775523042/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2417/1775523042_21a621f4e2_m.jpg" alt="Neighbourhood Salad" border="0" height="147" width="278" /></a></p>\r\nMy lunch for the day was almost entirely local, a very suitable dish for the plot.

Not sure what the heck happened on the waste front last week but I\'m going to blame the veg box. I could barely carry the bag of peelings, vacuum crud and shredded paper and by the time I added my friends sack of grass clippings to the load I was really struggling.\r\n\r\nStill, it\'s got to be done. Compost is my new passion of the moment and as I have three bins to fill I can\'t slack on the waste production front. I was even tempted to pick up a few discarded pumpkin heads on my way but that was just too much.\r\n\r\nIt was practically dark by 3pm today so I had to light my way by a rather impressive bonfire. It was my best so far and actually managed to make an impact on my mountain of couch grass roots. It\'s also provided a good heap of high potash ash that should give my fruit trees a good spurt for next year.

Today I did bonfire building (which is actually quite hard to get bored of), lacewing hotel making, weeding (doh!), transplanting, manky chard nurturing, cloche making and compost stirring.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate to find my broad beans pretty much in one piece but I wasn\'t going to risk it with the pigeons and chose to knock up a protective fleece cloche with my last bits of blue piping. The fleece turned out to be the perfect size, something like 8m by 1.5m and it only cost £2.99 from Wilkinsons. Wish I\'d got another pack at that price.\r\n\r\nI mentioned last week that my first delivery of plug plants had got lost in the postal strike. Well my little chard plants and assorted brassicas finally turned up after 3 weeks locked inside a cardboard box. Most of the plants were complete mush as you\'d expect and went straight into the compost pile but a few of the chard plants seemed to have a few leaves still in the land of the living.

It seems my brother knows special tricks for the removal of stubborn screws and the shed dream was back on. With excitement creeping back, I booked the van (after checking it would take an 8x6ft shed) and then headed to the plot to prepare the site.\r\n\r\nSeems a little strange to prepare the soil for planting a shed but I was worried about it becoming a safe haven for bindweed if I left any roots. Now I risk the shed sinking instead but the ricketier it looks, the safer it will be.\r\n\r\nEarly last Saturday morning the 4 of us headed to my friends to start ripping the shed apart. What a job that was. After getting all the screws undone but before pushing the shed apart like a pack of cards, the question was asked - "should we not just put it back together and leave it well alone?" Clearly there was an inkling of the trouble ahead.\r\n\r\nWe continued and after about 4 hours had the shed piled up in a heap ready for me to go and fetch the van, parked about 8 miles away in central London. I was a little concerned when I saw the van, VW Transporters aren\'t that big really, but I had asked the question and was told it would fit so I drove it back.\r\n\r\nSo much for asking questions and really I suppose you shouldn\'t trust anyone to do trigonometric calculations when you are quite capable of doing them yourself and discovering that the doors are more than a foot too short! Curses!  Where do you get a whopping great van without notice at 4pm on a Saturday. No where is the answer.\r\n\r\nWe carried the shed back into my friends garden. I went back to drop the useless van off and spent the rest of the evening trying to get my dad and brother drunk on vintage port so that they weren\'t too concerned about all the wasted effort.\r\n\r\nNext morning I managed to hire a massive hi-top transit van and we were back on the job by 9am. Vintage port gives the sort of headache that doesn\'t welcome early mornings and hard labour. Still, the shed fitted like a dream and we were off to cause havoc at the allotment site.\r\n\r\nSunday morning is no time for trying to squeeze the biggest damn vehicle ever down the middle of the site. I must have disturbed just about every plot holder there and anxiety levels were sky high. We unloaded it pretty quickly though and I skulked off to dispose of the van. By the time I was back it seemed the shed was almost up! And I promise I didn\'t take my time, I was only gone for about 15 mins. My brother is clearly an ace at construction.\r\n<p style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/2062514303/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2174/2062514303_31b6b1f7e4_m.jpg" alt="Shed Erectors 1" border="0" height="180" width="240" /></a></p>\r\n I didn\'t really do a lot, I just looked on with gradually declining anxiety and fetched screws. When I finally got to look inside I discovered that my dad and brother had knocked up some fantastic staging and laid a laminate floor! This is definitely going to be a home from home.\r\n\r\nWith the shed up my brother had to shoot off home (and I didn\'t even give him any lunch). My mum and I set too with the organising, finding special spots to hang the tools and finishing off the shelving. As if they hadn\'t all done enough by this point they started digging over some of the areas I\'ve missed, planting bulbs around the pond and constructing a permanent bench.

Even mine seems to have adopted a sense of the seasonal spirit, I should have taken some mulled wine and chestnuts to roast over a little blaze of bindweed roots.\r\n\r\nWhen I first took on the plot, one of my more experienced neighbours told me that most of the site remains free of frost year round but that they occasionaly get a freak frost that passes through a handful of plots in a diagonal band. My plot is definitely within Jack Frost\'s dropzone, he scatters the ice through my plot like rivulets. In some areas I had to jump on the fork to crack through the frozen tilth but then a foot to the side I found myself squelching in a soggy patch.

I don\'t think they will cast much shade (at least not on my plot) and may even benefit the remaining crops by providing some wind protection and by discouraging the fox from running through.\r\n\r\nDigging has proved to be painfully slow. I\'m dealing with the patch in front of the shed, which the previous occupant had formed into a long ridge. There have been a couple of similar ridges across the plot, one of these comprised numerous mango pips buried in the ridge and covered with layers of newspaper. This one appears to contain nothing but couch grass roots, it\'s so dense in there that not even soil has managed to find its way in. It is so tough to dig, I can get my fork in but can\'t get it back out. I\'m having to loosen the whole ridge and then go back over and peel it back like a decaying, detritus covered roll of axminster.

I still wasn\'t feeling on top form so my plans centred mostly around my new chair and dreams of a hot steaming mug of tea.\r\n\r\nMy mug of choice was A Room of One\'s Own - Virginia Woolf, so apt for the shed I think, and my stirrer is a little family heirloom from my Gran.\r\n\r\nHowever, these were just dreams. I actually woke to an email from a freecyclist offering me a gift of a 9ft extendable ladder. Now as I\'m in need of a ladder to apply some roofing felt to the shed I was very happy to take him up on his offer, but herein started a 2.5 hour challenge to claim the goodies.\r\n\r\nThe ladders lay 6 miles to the west of me, an easy enough cycle but it was quite an ordeal to lug them back. My trusty revolution cargo trailer proved its worth again though and really took the weight off me. Most of the route was along the thankfully straight dual carriageway - it is understandably tricky to steer a rigid 9ft bike around tight bends.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/2172111281/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2291/2172111281_0d3b77182e.jpg" alt="06012008046" border="0" height="375" width="500" /></a>\r\n\r\nI was knackered by the time I arrived on the plot, so stopped for the first in a long line of cuppas. After this essential revival, I started on the roofing task.\r\n\r\nApplying roofing felt is quite tricky, I made a fair old mess of it all and am choosing not to illustrate the point as its too embarrassing. I even had a barracking from someone waiting on the train platform opposite, who informed me I had put it on upside down. He\'s probably right. I daubed the edges with bitumen paint so it should do the trick anyway.\r\n\r\nTalking of bitumen, I met my closest plot neighbour today, seems we keep missing each other. Anyway she was just passing by with her kids to pick up something from her shed and popped over to introduce herself. We shook hands and I\'m afraid she left covered in the black tar that had somehow spread itself across my palm.

I have a stack of wood offcuts lying around that either littered the plot when I took it on, or came with the freebie shed. I\'ve had my eye on one of the planks for a bird box.\r\n\r\nRather like the roofing task, I rather botched this one as well, cutting the base too short. Still, I was able to wing it by substituting the roof. I then fashioned a new roof with some extra thin ply, covered it in an offcut of roofing felt and bashed nails in liberally.\r\n\r\nI was at the bashing stage, feeling rather hopeless about the future of the box when a little Robin came and settled on the doorstep of my shed and watched my progress for a while.\r\n\r\nI hope he comes and lives there.\r\n\r\n*UPDATE*\r\n\r\nI\'ve just found what appears to be the <a href="http://www.bto.org/notices/nestbox.pdf">definitive guide</a> to designing bird boxes for specific species and it informs me that Robins like open fronted boxes, not tiny squeeze threw hole boxes.

I was free in the afternoon so headed off to the plot with my newly delivered peach tree. I bought this from <a href="http://www.blackmoor.co.uk/">Blackmoor Nurseries</a> and the variety, Avalon Pride, is apparently resistant to leaf curl. If I can plant it against a SW-erly wall I should be rewarded with juicy fruit some years hence.\r\n\r\nMy shed is approximately SW facing, if you are a glass half full person,  so I\'ve decided to train it as a fan underneath the bird box. This required some brave and ruthless pruning. The stump you see in the photo is the result of two days of nervous nibbling with the secateurs. It seems such a tragic waste to hack off hard grown branches, especially when the tree cost £25, I\'ve already relegated about £10 quids worth to the incinerator.\r\n\r\nToday wasn\'t such a great day, cold and flippin windy but I managed to get quite a lot done. You\'ve got to love sheds, regardless of how bitter the day is, you\'ve always got a little retreat. A perfect home from home. Everyone should have a strategically placed shed with a supply of tea bags and digestive biscuits, it\'s practically a human rights issue.\r\n\r\nSo I started with a bit of digging - I still haven\'t cleared that peculiar ridge of bindweed and couch grass roots that I mentioned a few weeks back, and then I chose to start building a path.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/2238846609/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2404/2238846609_641ca3bdae.jpg" alt="Allotment path." border="0" height="375" width="500" /></a>\r\n\r\nAt the moment I seem to be wandering haphazardly across the plot, compacting the area I\'ve already dug, so I need to add some order.

As soon as I took the hammer to the stakes the whole frame decided to blow apart. 30 bent nails later I managed to get it to stay together for long enough to step away from the disaster area.\r\n\r\nI intend to use it as a stale seed bed for starting off my cabbage and leek plants.

I carried on where I left off yesterday and weeded most of the remaining beds. The peas are getting a bit lanky as well so I stuck some titchy sticks in to keep them on the straight and narrow til the weather becomes more stable and I can remove the mesh cover. There were quite a few empty stations where the peas either didn\'t germinate or were swiped by meeces so I popped in a few spare seeds, hopefully they\'ll come along soon enough and pad out the row.\r\n\r\nBefore I came down to the allotment this morning, I passed by Shakti\'s for breakfast. She posed the question "If we ran out of money tomorrow, what would we live off from your plot?" About 3 months ago she sowed the pea seeds that I supported above and can\'t quite believe that we aren\'t eating fresh garden peas yet. I don\'t thinks she\'s altogether too impressed with the DIY food malarkey, life is just a little more instantaneous down at Tescos.\r\n<p style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/2288140965/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2299/2288140965_bb53dfe4b7_m.jpg" alt="Hardly Self Sufficient" border="0" height="180" width="240" /></a></p>\r\nOn arrival I surveyed the crops with a hungry mind but was somewhat disillusioned.  I think the only currently edible produce is cabbage and some other critter already seems to have eaten way more than I will ever get to enjoy. Don\'t these look like a pitiful bunch?\r\n\r\nSo in answer to the question, I think we would survive for about a week on limp cabbage leaf. Life would then get tough unless I could find an inspiring recipe for roasted bind weed and couch grass roots.

My flat is no go zone for anything green, within 24 hrs every living form of plant life collapses in an irradiated heap. Quite concerning but I seem to cope unscathed. Anyway, the seeds need to live somewhere warmer and brighter than the shed, but safer than my flat so I\'ve sent them to germinate at Shakti\'s house.

By 9am I was out on the riverbank, squeezing in another neglected pastime by running to the plot.\r\n\r\nTypically, when I arrived the sunshine had disappeared behind a grey cloud but although it was pelting it down about 10 yards to the left of me, I seemed to be able to get on with my digging untouched. Commuters were huddled under brollies on the station platform and probably thought I was nuts not to take shelter but even as the rain cloud moved over and started its symphony on the pond surface, I was left in a little dry patch.

Skip space is a highly valued commodity and keen not to miss out I finished my morning jog with an interval session. For non-runners this effectively means sprints followed by slow recovery runs. I ran too and fro my plot grabbing the filled sacks of bindweed roots, it was like a rather muddy supermarket sweep. So now the sacks have gone and the huge mountain of perennial weeds sitting slap bang in the middle of my courgette spot have been disposed of.\r\n\r\nIn the end I didn\'t go and kidnap any frogs from the local ponds. I read on an amphibian wildlife site that frogs are currently under threat from a virus that is spreading across the country - red leg virus, and the sharing of spawn is only exacerbating the spread. I just have to sit tight and hope that news of the delightful residence spreads fast. I did however, transfer some wildlife from the water butt adjacent to the pond. It was absolutely teeming with tiny water boatman and I thought they\'d be much safer in the pond - less risk of them being tipped onto my tomatoes to dry out slowly in the sun.\r\n\r\nI\'m happy again now and can go back to work replenished if a little shattered.', 'Stolen Time', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'stolen-time', '', '', '2008-03-27 23:37:45', '2008-03-27 22:37:45', '', 0, 'http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/archives/48', 0, 'post', '', 3, '');

I\'ve heard recently of a few websites that are offering plot design and garden layout tools so I tried out <a href="http://www.plangarden.com">Plangarden</a> which has two week free trial before asking your for a $20 per year subscription.\r\n\r\nThis enables you to draw up a visual image of your plot. I\'m using it here to remember which variety of spud belongs to which row and to determine how much space I have left for everything I have left to sow.\r\n\r\nIt is its pretty useful but I\'ve done it now and can\'t quite see why I would carry on and pay for the subscription. There are a few other features such as a planting guide which aims to tell you according to location when it is appropriate to start planting. For my location it tells me that the last predicted spring frost will be the 25th April, so just one more month of anxiety to go.\r\n\r\nThere are two other gardening websites that I am much more convinced by and would like to recommend to you, these are <a href="http://www.myfolia.com/gardener/earthwoman/invite">myfolia</a> and <a href="http://www.blotanical.com/">blotanical</a> and both are free.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://myfolia.com/gardener/earthwoman">Myfolia</a> is a beautifully designed website, it enables you to keep track of multiple different gardens eg veg patch, herb garden, flower bed and then monitor individual plantings in each. From there you can write blog posts and progress reports related to your plantings. It is linked to the online photo albums, flickr and picassa, so is very easy to create visually impactful posts.\r\n\r\nI think this site is going to be invaluable when it comes to looking back and deciding when was the most successful time for planting broad beans for example. I have two rows planted a month apart and I will keep the progress reports going until they both crop.\r\n\r\nThe only thing about the site that I don\'t like, is the enclosed nature of the website, I think you have to sign up in order to view the content so any blog post you write will only be seen by other members. This isn\'t really a problem for me as I have an external blog anyway but I\'d like to see an rss feed (or somesuch) that sucks in my existing posts rather requiring me to recreate them inside myfolia.\r\n\r\nI\'m sure things will change though, the developers are really keen to receive feedback and have made some great enhancements recently. For example the site also provides a few widgets to transfer myfolia content to your blog, on the lefthand toolbar I have a widget from myfolia detailing my latest plantings.\r\n\r\n<em>Apologies for the length of this post, we are now approaching the "and finally" bit.</em>\r\n\r\nAnd finally, there is <a href="http://www.blotanical.com">blotanical</a>. This is a great site, essentially a community of garden bloggers.

Something clearly needs to be done if I ever hope to grow intact lettuces.\r\n\r\nSo, today marked the first assault on the slug flotilla.\r\n\r\nThere appear to be a number of options for dispatching slugs. You can squish them, a simple option but slug slime is stickier than melted chewing gum and its not the sort of thing you want lingering on the bottom of your shoe. Slug pellets are another obvious choice but are pretty damaging to the rest of the wildlife and would probably ensure I never see a frog or hedgehog on my plot again, plus I wouldn\'t want them near my food. You can also purchase special slug hating nematodes which are apparently approved of by the soil association and other organic gardening watchdogs but although I can accept that nematodes already exist in my soil I am just not going to enjoy eating my cabbage when I know I\'ve just watered it with a solution of parasitic worms. That leaves me with a painless option that I read about in my magazine yesterday - death by drowning.\r\n\r\nI wiped about 30 beasties from the side of my compost bin into an inch of water in  bucket. Almost immediately the slime factories puffed up a little and seemed to turn pale. Happy with a job well done, I turned away and carried on with my mammoth digging task.\r\n\r\n10 minutes later I happened to be passing the bucket and saw at least 28 slugs fighting for pole position at the rim of the bucket. I sloshed more water in from a height and knocked them back into the drink. 10 mins later the process had to be repeated, this time I added a dash of my beer dregs that I have been saving for months, thinking this would encourage them to linger for a bit longer.\r\n\r\nI must have been a bit tight with the beer because, you guessed it, 10 mins later they are back at the rim. Now I\'m scraping them off with my spade and stirring vigorously. Its turning into quite a frenzied killing session and I\'m not feeling too good about it. Who said drowning was painless? The darn creatures just won\'t play dead. Perhaps I have cultivated a specific variety of deep sea diving slugs.\r\n\r\nAfter 6 hrs on the plot it was time to go but the slugs were still not finished, I sliced a couple of particularly feisty specimens with my secateurs and left the others to their own devices.\r\n\r\nI would say the slugs won the first battle.

I love capers but don\'t feel so upbeat about the price of the tiny little jars so I\'ve been wanting to try out this cheapskate trick for ages.\r\n\r\nI\'ve got a few plants started in the front room nursery and have just scattered a few more seeds around the plot today. Nasturtiums are a really useful plant, they are beautifully gaudy, attract blackfly like you wouldn\'t believe - thereby saving the broad beans from suffocation by the black beasties and the leaves add a peppery pungent taste to salads. If the pickling trick works, nasturtiums could easily make it into my top 5 desirable plant list.\r\n\r\nHere\'s the recipe I\'m going to try:\r\n\r\nCollect as many green nasturtium seeds as you can muster - you pick these after the flowers have dropped but before they dry out, soak them overnight in a salty brine and then drop them into the boiled and cooled pickling concoction. I\'ll keep these in jars and shove them in the fridge but may update the recipe and storage instructions once I learn some pickling techniques.\r\n\r\n1 mug white wine vinegar\r\n2 teaspoons salt\r\n1 small onion, thinly sliced\r\nA few slices of lemon\r\n1 bay leaf\r\nPinch of mustard seeds\r\n2 cloves garlic\r\n6 peppercorns', 'Pickled Nasturtium Seeds', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'pickled-nasturtium-seeds', '', '', '2008-04-17 19:50:49', '2008-04-17 18:50:49', '', 0, 'http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/archives/55', 0, 'post', '', 9, '');

Even though it seemed to have been sorted out on my half of the site by the next morning, it acted as a trigger for me to start a water conservation project. I acquired a water butt from freecycle and the weekend was scheduled to create a shed, butt and guttering ensemble.\r\n\r\nHow long could it take to install a single span of guttering?  To give the game away right from the start, it took me 3 hours and as I left the guttering was propped up on the inside of the shed, thereby serving absolutely no use whatsoever. Perhaps a few more hours tomorrow will see the task complete.\r\n\r\nI started by siting the butt at the back of the shed, leveling the ground and preparing a raised support, then I had to repeat the whole process at the other side of the shed as someone had seen fit to install a <a href="http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/archives/30">flippin birdbox</a> slap in the middle of my guttering route. I intended to put the gutter with a slight downward slope so that the water just trickles into the butt without the need for fancy attachments and downpipes but my first attempt failed at the first hurdle - the roof overhang went beyond my guttering and the rain just slipped over the edge.\r\n\r\nBatons were sourced and cut to force the guttering out beyond the overhang but then I had a problem with my screws - too short - too long - the usual. I got a bit knarked and started hammering the screws and a few nails until walloped my finger with a direct blow. I wanted to hop, scream and swear like a lunatic but an audience had assembled on the overlooking platform. I had to smile and take cover in the shed until I could cope with the throbbing finger. It also gave me the opportunity to retrieve all the items scattered on the floor after my banging frenzy.\r\n\r\nI regained my composure and finished the job off, slid the guttering into the brackets and went in search of some water to test the trajectory. Still with an audience I poured a bottle of water into the middle of the guttering only to be welcomed with a splattering sound at the wrong end - someone installed the shed on a flipping slope. You just can\'t get the workmen these days!\r\n\r\nOff to Homebase again to buy an end piece for the guttering so that the water gets directed back in the right direction.  Guttering apparently works with some impossible connection that took 3 beefy guys from the customer service section to be able to break into. I was sent off with the suggestion that I loosen up the rubber with some hot water and washing up liquid. I needed a cuppa tea anyway so just chucked the end piece into some boiling water on the trangia. When I remembered to fish it out again it looked a little on the overcooked side and rather twisted out of shape. No hope that it would fit on the end in the designed fashion. Not to be outdone I opened up my tub of bitumen and smeared great dollops around both ends of the pipe. So now its propped inside the shed, hopefully drying into super sturdy water proof seal. We\'ll see tomorrow.\r\n<p style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/2425451304/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/2425451304_c9c2073972_m.jpg" alt="Whopping Cabbage" border="0" height="240" width="180" /></a></p>\r\nAlthough I am clearly the worlds worst DIY\'er I can console myself with being probably the worlds best cabbage grower.

This could very easily have been my undoing.\n\nI warn all potential jam makers to skim read any recipe like instructions that slip into this post. \nDo not repeat. \n\nI started following the methodology from <a href="http://www.allotment.org.uk/recipe/49/recipe-for-marrow-jam/">allotment.org.uk</a>, chopping the squash up smallish and covering with a kg of special jam making sugar (complete with pectin) before leaving to do something over night in the fridge.\n\nThey came out pretty wet.\n\nI then switched over to <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/7565/marrow-and-ginger-jam">bbcgoodfood</a> and continued with the latter stages of their instructions. This involved bagging up lemons carcasses, pips and peel in muslin and boiling away with the sugar and squash mix.  \n\nI got called away for an emergency Ikea visitation which delayed the boiling bit for a few hours but I wacked it up high on our return and let it bubble furiously in attempt to turn the courgette chunks mushy. The sugar appeared to caramelise under the assault but the courgettes remained unscathed.\n\nBy this point I\'d been cooking the jam on and off for 20 hours and I was getting a bit desperate. The gloop wasn\'t even remotely interested in setting and the internet suggested I may have destroyed the pectin in the special sugar by over heating. Curses!\n\nI bottled it up regardless and it now sits in the fridge, taunting the children. \n\n<a class="tt-flickr tt-flickr-Medium" title="Marrow Jam" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/3858744506/"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2649/3858744506_1eec95f180.jpg" alt="Marrow Jam" width="500" height="500" /></a>\n\nTwo days later it still hasn\'t set. \nThe yellow courgette slices spin happily in a golden yellow amniotic fluid, I think it is taunting me.\n\nI can report that the taste is pretty good actually. Very marmaladey. A sharp gingery lemoness, that is really quite appealing. I may have another go soon but in the meantime I need to concentrate on getting rid of the pumpkin.\n', 'Marrow Jam', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '231-revision-4', '', '', '2009-08-27 22:26:19', '2009-08-27 21:26:19', '', 231, 'http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/2009/08/27/231-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0, '');

I was of the view that without a hammer, a ladder, the time, the inclination or the right clothes, we should put the soon to be rotten shed roof to the back of our minds and continue with Plan A, returning to the shed problem next week. \r\n\r\nLynn isn\'t built out of the same "sit down and ponder over a cup of tea" mould as me and it was clear that we were going to have to get this job done pronto or suffer the consequences.\r\n\r\nPlans were hastily rearranged and after a quick retreat for tools (and a flask of tea) we were back and ready for action.\r\n\r\nI tucked myself well away from the stressy end of the plot and dealt with the rubbish pile while Lynn got up close and personal with the shed. \r\n\r\nThe rubbish pile was the main reason for our planned quick visit, most of it had already gone – thanks to the committee ladies who had been helping us to dispose of all the crud.  All that remained was for me to bag up the few remaining bits of polythene and carpet and evict a few squatters. Seven mice and a toad ran clear of the carpet (at least the mice ran, the toad just looked aghast and covered up his private parts). \r\n\r\nWe’ll have to add “Build Wildlife Haven” to our construction to do list now.\r\n\r\nWe left the plot with a new air of satisfied calm - the shed roof was repaired before the rains returned and the shed interior began to take shape as the "Room of One\'s Own Mug" returns to it\'s rightful centre stage spot in the prized construction.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/400_mug.jpg" alt="400_mug" title="400_mug" width="400" height="296" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-320" />', 'A Stormy Kind of Calm', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'a-stormy-kind-of-calm', '', '', '2009-11-16 14:09:30', '2009-11-16 13:09:30', '', 0, 'http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/?p=300', 0, 'post', '', 1, '');

Anyone with digging requirements would do well to try and attract my mum to their plot!\r\n\r\nMe and dad filled the time by creating another architectural wonder and planting a few rows of onion sets.

The flippin things wouldn\'t budge and faced with the enormity of my task I sat down in a little sulky heap and tried to remove all shed dreams from my memory banks.\r\n<p style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/2038151508/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2032/2038151508_0a47335646_m.jpg" alt="Shed Foundations" border="0" height="180" width="240" /></a></p>\r\n Following a call to the family, I discovered that there are many people way more talented than me on the DIY front. It seems my brother knows special tricks for the removal of stubborn screws and the shed dream was back on. With excitement creeping back, I booked the van (after checking it would take an 8x6ft shed) and then headed to the plot to prepare the site.\r\n\r\nSeems a little strange to prepare the soil for planting a shed but I was worried about it becoming a safe haven for bindweed if I left any roots. Now I risk the shed sinking instead but the ricketier it looks, the safer it will be.\r\n\r\nEarly last Saturday morning the 4 of us headed to my friends to start ripping the shed apart. What a job that was. After getting all the screws undone but before pushing the shed apart like a pack of cards, the question was asked - "should we not just put it back together and leave it well alone?" Clearly there was an inkling of the trouble ahead.\r\n\r\nWe continued and after about 4 hours had the shed piled up in a heap ready for me to go and fetch the van, parked about 8 miles away in central London. I was a little concerned when I saw the van, VW Transporters aren\'t that big really, but I had asked the question and was told it would fit so I drove it back.\r\n\r\nSo much for asking questions and really I suppose you shouldn\'t trust anyone to do trigonometric calculations when you are quite capable of doing them yourself and discovering that the doors are more than a foot too short! Curses!  Where do you get a whopping great van without notice at 4pm on a Saturday. No where is the answer.\r\n\r\nWe carried the shed back into my friends garden. I went back to drop the useless van off and spent the rest of the evening trying to get my dad and brother drunk on vintage port so that they weren\'t too concerned about all the wasted effort.\r\n\r\nNext morning I managed to hire a massive hi-top transit van and we were back on the job by 9am. Vintage port gives the sort of headache that doesn\'t welcome early mornings and hard labour. Still, the shed fitted like a dream and we were off to cause havoc at the allotment site.\r\n\r\nSunday morning is no time for trying to squeeze the biggest damn vehicle ever down the middle of the site. I must have disturbed just about every plot holder there and anxiety levels were sky high. We unloaded it pretty quickly though and I skulked off to dispose of the van. By the time I was back it seemed the shed was almost up! And I promise I didn\'t take my time, I was only gone for about 15 mins. My brother is clearly an ace at construction.\r\n<p style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/2062514303/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2174/2062514303_31b6b1f7e4_m.jpg" alt="Shed Erectors 1" border="0" height="180" width="240" /></a></p>\r\n I didn\'t really do a lot, I just looked on with gradually declining anxiety and fetched screws. When I finally got to look inside I discovered that my dad and brother had knocked up some fantastic staging and laid a laminate floor! This is definitely going to be a home from home.\r\n\r\nWith the shed up my brother had to shoot off home (and I didn\'t even give him any lunch). My mum and I set too with the organising, finding special spots to hang the tools and finishing off the shelving. As if they hadn\'t all done enough by this point they started digging over some of the areas I\'ve missed, planting bulbs around the pond and constructing a permanent bench. I had to drag them away eventually so we could get some dinner.\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/2063302666/" class="tt-flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2185/2063302666_896f39e425.jpg" alt="25112007380" border="0" height="375" width="500" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt\'s almost a wonderful end to the weekend except for the fact that I seem to have broken some allomenting by-law. The shed is apparently too big for the site. Quite a bit too big. Now I\'m living in fear of being issued an eviction notice and having to go through the whole sorry process again. If push comes to shove I may take a chain saw to either end and make it smaller that way, but it would be a terrible shame.\r\n\r\nSo at the moment I am keeping a low profile, I need to go up to the plot to plant an apple tree and empty my overflowing compost bucket so I think now would be a fine time - tis absolutely belting it down. I bet I won\'t see a single soul there. I\'ll be able to plant my tree and sit in my dry shed admiring the view and waiting for the bulbs to poke through.', 'All Quiet on the Allotment Front', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '21-revision', '', '', '2007-12-02 14:22:20', '2007-12-02 13:22:20', '', 21, 'http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/2007/12/02/21-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0, '');

That and the absence of running water almost amounted to a deal breaker but I was keen to start the plot transfer before the growing season kicked in and hoped we might be able to broker a shed deal in the New Year.\r\n\r\nLast week we were rather overjoyed when a steady stream of committee members paid a visit and then offered us first dibs on an abandoned shed. It proved to be a rather smashing shed, probably a 7\' x 5\', half painted and yet completely draft proofed with expanding foam.\r\n\r\nRoll on this weekend and the perfectly planned visit from Reg, shed builder extraordinaire, aka Lynn\'s Dad.\r\n\r\n<p style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px"><a title="Sedan Chair by warriorwomen, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/warriorwomen/4058436023/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3511/4058436023_4e9e7a9040_m.jpg" alt="Sedan Chair" width="240" height="180" /></a></p>I\'ve done <a href="http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/2007/12/02/all-quiet-on-the-allotment-front/">shed transplanting</a> before and found it to be extremely stressful, so to be fair, if Reg were to come up with a suggestion that even hinted at making life easier, regardless of the comedy factor, I was going to jump at it.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was when Lynn arrived back. Reg had constructed a sedan chair par excellence.

I’d woken with a plan in my head and as an ever ready kind of a Scout, I just happen to keep a pad of grid paper by the bed for this sort of occurrence.\r\n\r\nHaving failed to find wire tensioners in Homebase last week I was pleased when my internet search uncovered a swanky new gadget for creating trellis constructions. It’s called the <a href="http://www.grippledirect.com/gard_prods.php">Gripple</a> and I promptly ordered myself the starter pack of 4 Gripples, 4 Eye Hooks and a 30m reel of plastic wire.\r\n\r\nThis is where my puzzling started. Using only the above items, how do I (<em>read: how does Lynn</em>) create a fanned peach supporting wire combo with 4 lengths? We went for the 3rd aesthetically pleasing option and headed down to the plot.\r\n\r\nI should perhaps have mentioned that we had chosen the weekend of the Severe Adverse Weather Warnings to partake in the peach transplantation event. It was a struggle removing the tree from the old plot with the famed light soil, a layer of ice had to be cracked away before the fork would gain entry and we ought to have thought about the difficulty of digging in our frozen heavy London clay plot.\r\nBut we didn’t.\r\n<p style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1335" title="Kaput Gripple" src="http://whatapalaver.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/20122009042-225x300.jpg" alt="Kaput Gripple" width="225" height="300" /></p>\r\n\r\nI was keen to play with the new toys but my hands were freezing and I had to run up and down the plot doing high knee raises and clapping my hands before I could contend with the fiddly bits.\r\n\r\nThe design of the "tensulator" was very smart and when it work I was very impressed. When it didn\'t work, I let myself down rather a lot and had one of those, throw yourself on the floor wailing, kinds of a strop. A bit embarassing.\r\n\r\nHere I am, pre-wailing, trying to force the wire to go through the Gripple and out the other end so that I could loop it back. No amount of forcing was going to tease the wire through and the thing is designed not to let me pull the wire back out again and it wouldn\'t.\r\n\r\n<em>Cue strop</em>.\r\n<p style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1341" title="Gripple in Action" src="http://whatapalaver.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Gripple-in-Action-225x300.jpg" alt="Gripple in Action" width="225" height="300" /></p>\r\n\r\nWe had to cut it off in the end and Lynn took it away to the shed to perform some kind of surgery on it (or perhaps she thought if she left me alone I\'d stop flouncing). \r\n\r\nWe managed to get this one on successfully in the end but another Gripple got stuck after looping it around and without wasting loads of wire we couldn\'t cut this one off. It was in a locked position but couldn\'t be tensioned and so the finished job looked a bit naff but worked in a fashion.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know why we had trouble with two of the Gripples, if I\'d had a pack of spares I wouldn\'t have got myself too worried but I needed all 4.\r\n\r\nThe working ones were very neat and it proved easy to build up the tension.

With the feathering of snow also comes a peaceful calm that I rarely notice anywhere else. It\'s a beautiful site.\r\n\r\nThe recent wet weather has made a huge difference to the clay, it\'s incredibly heavy but you can at least force your tools through the surface.

Lynn would of course argue that she worked the hardest as she planted 7 rows of spuds while I weeded the seed bed and prepared some labels with my Brother P Touch - pah!\r\n\r\nWeeding that seed bed was the devils own job. We\'d planted onions, lettuce and assorted brassicas under the glazed area some weeks back but pretty much the only thing that had germinated was a field of weeds. After half an hour of dabbling around with a tweezer to uncover 1 lettuce and 3 brassica seedlings it occurred to me that it would be a far better idea to blitz the lot with a hoe and start again.\r\n\r\nOur potato planting led to some interesting debates.

We opted for the Dig your Own method: 1/2 spade depth furrow, place in spud and then cover with soil and a sprinkling of manure. No earthing up until the foliage starts to poke through.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://whatapalaver.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0613.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1635" title="Tunnel Pride" src="http://whatapalaver.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0613-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>The experienced voice tells us to dig a trench, place in manure with spuds on top and then earth up enough to allow the rain to run off and prevent rotting. I know it sounds sensible and was in fact my method of old, but its hard work and in clay, I\'m all for short cuts. I do hope the buggers don\'t rot though, I\'ll never hear the end of it.\r\n\r\nWe have set ourselves a challenge to excel at two crops this year - peas and leeks. Of course we want all our crops to be prizewinners but these two have proved to be challenging in the past.\r\n\r\nI wouldn\'t waste time with the autumn sown peas - horrible dry things, but I think a hot day at the end of March might be perfect for the sweet summer variety. We prepared two drills and I started laying out the seeds in a perfect arrangement - square layout with a centre pea, then had a flashback to last years germination rate and walked back along my row scattering the rest of the packet.\r\n\r\nHere\'s Lynn proudly constructing the mesh cloche over the sowings.\r\n\r\nWe also had time to set the uber cheap summer bulbs (care of Lidl) by the rhubarb patch and get in a few rows of carrots and parsnips. I\'ve gone mad with carrots again, so along with the standard Nantes varieties I\'ve got some Red Samurai and Purple Haze, so with my usual <a href="http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/2008/06/02/don%e2%80%99t-panic-carrot-returns/">carrot success rate</a> these are all set to be mighty expensive tubers again.', 'Spud Dispute', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'spud-dispute', '', '\nhttp://www.earthwoman.co.uk/2008/06/02/don%e2%80%99t-panic-carrot-returns/', '2010-04-06 09:01:14', '2010-04-06 08:01:14', '', 0, 'http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/?p=357', 0, 'post', '', 3, '');

Great.\r\n\r\nSweet Potatoes are usually cultivated from slips which I think are the shoots that you can see on my sweet potato photo. They can be potted up and grown on before planting out in May but I imagine they will still grow ok if you chuck the whole tuber in. This one will never be harvested though, they need about 4 to 6 months of sunshine to mature and I don\'t expect we\'ll have a lot of that between November and February.\r\n\r\nI\'ll be sure to let you know if anything outstanding happens.', 'Growing, or at least Planting Sweet Potatoes', 0, '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'growing-or-at-least-planting-sweet-potatoes', '', '', '2010-08-13 20:48:06', '2010-08-13 19:48:06', '', 0, 'http://www.earthwoman.co.uk/?p=396', 0, 'post', '', 3, 'index,follow');

I\'ve had a go at this on one of my foraging trips and the demonstration looks very thorough.\n\n<a href="http://www.newhollandpublishers.com/details.asp?pid=9781847736642&amp;t=Allotment-Source-Book"><strong>The Allotment Source Book</strong></a> by Caroline Foley is available from New Holland Publishers.\nEnter the discount code <strong>warrior</strong> at the checkout to receive 20% off and free P&amp;P.

Still, when it comes to food and nutrition he drives me nuts.\r\n\r\nHis main premise is that we should look to wild animals for advice on what to eat, after all they don\'t get sick or obese. Somehow he manages to jump from wild animals to the instruction to eat a vegetarian diet with fruit and nothing but fruit for breakfast. I can cope with all of that and resist the temptation to argue the point of predation and age-related conditions but when he starts on slugs and snails I\'m afraid the book has to go into the charity pile again.\r\n\r\nI know about slugs and I\'m not too enamored of them. Allen likes to use the example of the slothful slug and snail to illustrate his suggestion that exercise is overrated. You don\'t really need to exercise as, after all, have you ever seen an obese snail? That sets me wondering. If I match sluggy slime trails to body length, I reckon our squidgy friends are really quite active critters, especially of a damp evening and if we are going to be critical, I\'m not sure I\'d consider them the slenderest of creatures either.

This book attempts to fuse nutritional advice with the buddhist concept of mindfulness through the discussion of the four noble truths and a series of exercises or meditations that encourage a focus on the present. Mindfulness is not restricted to eating and Thich Nhat Hanh takes us through mindfulness for eating, exercise and living.\r\n\r\nThe eating messages I\'ve taken home are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Eat at the table</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid multitasking - so no TV, work or magazines</li>\r\n	<li>Appreciate your food by use of all the senses</li>\r\n	<li>Chew and take it slowly</li>\r\n	<li>Quality not quantity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThere is a particularly useful exercise on appreciating the apple and I\'d encourage anyone to spend 10 minutes with a Discovery apple, reacquainting yourself with its joys.\r\n\r\nI\'m a big fan of food and this time of year is particularly conducive to appreciating food. The plot is so productive that I can\'t help but serve up meals that are at least 70% home grown and it is such a delight to look at the plate and remember the soil turning, seed sowing, weeding and watering that led to the harvest.\r\n\r\nWe\'ve snuck a few yellow courgette plants into the flower border at home and I find their unexpected presence on the plate extremely satisfying.\r\n\r\nNot content with the first two books on food, I\'ve turned now to Michael Pollen for the down to earth advice succinctly wrapped up in the title of this post: Eat Food, Not Too Much, Mostly Plants.

Although I haven\'t actually foraged much further afield than Borough Market, I am currently preparing a pot of slow cooked, wild, rabbit stew. I might not have shot it myself but I was rather perturbed when I noticed bunny fur remaining on the quartered carcass. De-fluffing the tea brought me a bit too close to the harsh realities of our carnivorous lifestyle but that can only be a good thing.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure I\'ll be able to persuade any one else to join me for a serving so I\'ve taken the precaution of preparing a backup leek and potato soup.\r\n\r\nBack to the book, John committed a year of his life to eating wild produce hunted or foraged within the grounds of a derelict farmhouse that he and his wife had bought to renovate. It sounds like a hell-ish challenge. He started in game season so he had plenty of meat to hand but had to grub around for meager offerings of greenery. He managed to poison himself more than once by over-reliance on dubious quality produce.\r\n\r\nHis ingredients list for February reads:\r\n<blockquote>Pigeon, rabbit, squirrel, dandelion, corn salad, nettles</blockquote>\r\nHe was pretty strict about the source of his food and so beyond the stuff he gathered or shot on a daily basis he would have to rely on foods he\'d managed to preserve or dry such as nuts, oils, rosehip syrup and copious quantities of alcohol.\r\n\r\nI think I was particularly inspired by his ability to keep himself stocked up with daily supplies of alcohol as well as his ability to stomach some of the concoctions brewed. Home brew wine is rank at the best of times and I don\'t think oak leaf wine would fare any better than the usual culprits. Dandelion and Burdock beer sounds delightful though and I was impressed to discover you can turn the brew around in about a week.\r\n\r\nThe book is illustrated with many historic and authentic hedgerow recipes which must have taken some time to unearth. We have Chickweed soup, Stuffed Bistort Leaves, Fat hen pancakes with horseradish and as I\'ve seen them lined up next to the rabbits at Borough Market, perhaps this one will do for next weekend:\r\n<blockquote><strong>Herby Squirrel Burgers</strong>\r\n<em>Serves 4</em>\r\n\r\n1lb/450g lean minced squirrel\r\n1 egg, beaten\r\n1 tbsp hedge garlic, chopped\r\n2 tsp equal parts wild thyme and wild chervil\r\npinch salt\r\n\r\nMix together the egg, meat, herbs and salt in a bowl.\r\nShape into flattened patties and fry in goose fat.
